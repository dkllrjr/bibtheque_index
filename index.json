A sphere \ncontact quantification model was developed to estimate the concentration of contact between them for any \nsimple random mixture. Comparing the evolution of gain of CO conversion (or hydrocarbon yield) with the \ntheoretical results, it was shown that the density of contact was identified as the key factor for the catalytic \nperformances (contact-activity relationship). Finally, the knowledge of the contact morphology, determined by \nFEG-SEM, allowed proposing the NH3-TPD as method characterizing the concentration of contact.   \n1.Introduction \nLight (C2-C4) hydrocarbons are important chemical building blocks \nfor a variety of useful derivatives in the petrochemical and chemical \nindustries [1,2] . They are presently produced worldwide in huge \namounts mostly by steam cracking of naphta which is highly \nenergy-consuming process. C2-C4 hydrocarbons synthesis from syngas \n(a mixture of CO and H2) is attractive since renewable carbon resources \n(biomass, wastes, CO2) are expected to gradually replace fossil fuels [3]. \nFischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis is the traditional process of converting \nsyngas to hydrocarbons [4]. However, the FT process is limited by the \nAnderson\u0000Schultz\u0000Flory (ASF) distribution and contain a small yield of \nC2-C4 hydrocarbons [5,6] . \nA two-step process including methanol synthesis (Reaction 1) fol-\nlowed by methanol-to-olefins (MTO, Reaction 2) process is commer -\ncially available to produce light hydrocarbons but development of a \nmore energetically and costly-efficient direct process is needed [7]. \nCO+2H2\u21ccCH 3OH (Reactionn 1)  \nnCH 3OH\u2192CnH2n+nH 2O (Reactionn 2) \nThe advantage of the single-step process is the achievement of both reactions (Reactions 1 and 2) in one reactor in order to simplify the \nprocess route and equipment [4]. This process is possible using a \nso-called hybrid or bifunctional catalyst. The bifunctional catalyst cor-\nresponds to a physical mixture of methanol synthesis catalyst (Cu-Z -\nnO-Al 2O3) and zeotype (SAPO-34), can lead to the formation of light \nhydrocarbons from syngas via methanol as reactional intermediate [4,8, \n9]. The main advantage of the single-step process is the elimination of \nthe restriction of methanol synthesis by the thermodynamic equilibrium \nshift (drain-off mechanism) [10]. It can be assumed therefore that the \nproximity between methanol synthesis catalyst and SAPO-34 (where the \nmethanol is converted) plays a significant role in the catalytic perfor -\nmances (high. CO conversion) and in the hydrocarbon selectivity [9]. \nIn the present work, we investigated the activity of hybrid catalyst \nfor the CO hydrogenation into hydrocarbons (HC) as a function con-\ncentration of contact between methanol synthesis catalyst (M1) and \nSAPO-34 (M2). In order to evaluate the effect of the proximity between \nM1 and M2, different catalytic bed dispositions (layer bed, denoted LB, \nand simple random mixture, denoted SRM) of both components have \nbeen adopted. Using a similar methodology as previously described [11, \n12], we built contact \u2013reactivity relationship on the basis of catalytic \nobservations. The results led us to formulate hypotheses concerning the \nmorphology of the contacts, as well as the development of a \n*Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: anthony.le.valant@univ-poitiers.fr (A.

Experimental data were compared with theo-\nretical calculations to validate the model. Finally, the knowledge of the \ncontact morphology, determined by field emission gun scanning elec-\ntron microscope (FEG-SEM), allowed proposing a method to charac -\nterize the concentration of contact of each hybrid catalyst. \n2.Materials and methods \n2.1. Materials \n2.1.1. Methanol synthesis catalyst \nA commercially available methanol synthesis copper-based catalyst \n(M1) was used. This is a material developed by Johnson Matthey and \nsold by Alfa Aesar (a Johnson Matthey company) in the form of \n5.4mm\u00d73.6mm pellets. These pellets were crushed and sized to \n160\u0000100 \u00b5m (in this form, the apparent density of the M1 (denoted \n\u03c1M1) material is equal to 1.23 gcm-3 and the radius of the M1 material is \nrM1 =65.0 \u00b5m). \n2.1.2. SAPO-34 \nA SAPO-34 zeolite (M2) in the form of fine powder was purchased \nfrom ACS Material. It was pelletized, crushed and sized to 160\u0000100 \u00b5m \n(in this form, the apparent density of the M2 (denoted \u03c1M2) material is \nequal to 0.94 gcm-3 and the radius of the M2 material is rM2 =65.0 \u00b5m). \n2.1.3. Hybrid catalysts \n2.1.3.1. Layer bed arrangements. The layer bed arrangements (denoted \nxLB(y), where x and y represent the number of layers and the number of \ncontacts, in terms of contact section between M1 and M2, respectively) \nare presented in the Table S1. The same amount of M1 (160\u0000100 \u00b5m) \nand M2 (160\u0000100 \u00b5m) reference materials was used for each of LB arrangement. The differences between the LB arrangements are the \nnumber of alternating layers between M1 and M2, resulting a change in \nthe number of contacts (see Table S1). \n2.1.3.2. Simple random mixture arrangements. The simple random \nmixture arrangements (denoted SRM(x), where x represents the M2 \nproportion) were prepared by simple mixing M1 (160\u0000100 \u00b5m) and M2 \n(160\u0000100 \u00b5m) reference materials with different weight ratios. The \ncharacteristics of SRM arrangements are presented in the Table S2. \n2.2. Characterization of materials \nThe morphology of the M1, M2 and reduced SRM(0.50) (reduced in \nthe same conditions as the catalytic test, see paragraph 2.3) catalysts \nwere studied using a field emission gun scanning electron microscope \n(FEG-SEM) 7900F from JEOL. This microscope is equipped with an \nEnergy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS) from Bru\u00a8cker (with Esprit \nsoftware) allowing the mapping of the Cu, Zn, Al, Mg, Si, P, O and C \ncontents. \nInductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) \nwas used for the determination of the metal content in M1 and M2 \nsamples. The measurements were performed with a Perkin Elmer Op-\ntima 2000DV spectrometer. The M1 sample was previously dissolved in \nan acidic mixture of HNO 3 and HCl to perform the analyses for Cu, Zn, Al \nand Mg. The M2 sample was dissolved into H2SO4 +HNO 3 +HF at \nboiling point to perform the analyses for Al and P. For the Si determi -\nnation, the solid was fused with lithium tetraborate into a Pt-Au crucible \nat 1100\u25e6C. The obtained solid was then dissolved into HCl. \nThe textural properties of the M1 and M2 catalysts were determined \nby adsorption \u2013desorption of nitrogen at the temperature of liquid ni-\ntrogen (\u0000196\u25e6C, 77K) using a Micromeritics Tristar and ASAP 2000 \ninstruments. Before measuring, the M1 was degassed at 250\u25e6C for 4h \nand the M2 was heated at 350\u25e6C overnight. The SBET surface areas were \nFig. 1.FEG-SEM images (a and b) and EDX mapping analysis (c) of M1 catalyst.  V. L\u2019hospital et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n3calculated according to the method of Brunauer, Emmet and Teller \n(BET). The Smicro surface area and Vmicro volume pore of M2 catalyst \nwere determined with the t-plot method. The Sexter external surface area \ncorresponds to the difference between SBET and Smicro and the Vexter \nexternal pore volume to the difference between the total pore volume \nand the Vmicro. \nIn situ X-ray diffractograms were carried out using a D8 advance \ndiffractometer in Bragg-Brentano configuration equipped with a Cu \nanode (Cu K\u03b1 radiation: 0.154184 nm) and a LynxEye XET 1-D detector. \nThe samples were mounted in an atmosphere-controlled Anton Paar \nXRK 900 reactor chamber. X-ray diffractograms were recorded in pure \nH2 (20mL\u22c5min-1) before and after reduction at 400\u25e6C for 30min with a \nstep of 0.03\u25e6(2\u03b8) and a counting time per step of 2s \nA Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 apparatus was employed for the \ntemperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurement. Approxi -\nmately 100mg of freshly M1 catalyst was introduced between two \nquartz wool balls into a quartz U-shaped tube. The TPR experiments was \ncarried out in 10% H2/Ar flowing at a rate of 30 NmL min-1 with a \ntemperature increase from 30\u25e6to 400\u25e6C at 5\u25e6Cmin-1 using a pro-\ngrammable temperature controller. Hydrogen consumption was moni -\ntored by a TCD detector. \nThe ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH 3-TPD) \nmeasurement was undertaken using a homemade apparatus equipped \nwith a TCD detector. For the analysis, 250mg of catalyst (M1, M2, LB \nand SRM arrangements) was placed in quartz reactor between two \nquartz wool layers. The catalyst was pretreated as follows: the temper -\nature of the catalyst bed was increased to 400\u25e6C (5\u25e6Cmin-1) under a H2 \nflow (30 NmL min-1) and this temperature was maintained for 30min. \nNext, the sample was purged with He at the same temperature and \nduration. Finally, the catalyst was cooled down to 100\u25e6C and this temperature was maintained for 30min. Adsorption of ammonia was \nthen carried out at 100\u25e6C for 60min. After purging with helium for \n60min, the analysis was carried out at a heating rate of 10\u25e6Cmin-1 from \n100\u25e6to 700\u25e6C. \nIn situ DRIFT spectra were achieved with a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spec-\ntrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with Praying Mantis \u2122 High \nTemperature Reaction Chamber (Harrick, model HVC-DRP-4) and MCT \ndetector cooled by liquid N2. The spectral resolution was 4cm-1. The \ntemperature gradient between the regulation thermocouple and the \nupper part of the powder sample was previously determined and cor-\nrected. The samples were firstly pre-treated at 400\u25e6C under 20mL.min-1 \nof He flow for 1h before NH3 chimisorption under 30mL.min-1 of 1% \nNH3-He flow and purging under 20mL.min-1 of He flow for 1h. Spectra \nwere then recorded from room temperature up to 400\u25e6C. \n2.3. Catalysis \nCatalytic performances of M1, M2, LB and SRM arrangements were \ncompared in a continuous fixed-bed stainless steel reactor (L =400mm, \n\u00d8int =6.35 mm). The details of the different arrangements used in this \nstudy are illustrated in Tables S1 and S2. For 2LB(0) arrangement, M1 \nand M2 were separated with a layer of SiC (0.60 g). \nBefore reaction, the catalyst was pre-treated in situ at 400\u25e6C for \n30min (heating rate of 5\u25e6Cmin-1) under a flow of pure H2 (1.8 NL h-1) \nat atmospheric pressure. Then, the reactor was purged with argon and \nthe pressure was increased to 30bar. The reactor was then flushed with \nthe reactant gas mixture (H2/CO/Ar:53/21/26, 6 NL h-1) at 400\u25e6C. The \noutlet flow was decompressed and periodically injected in an Agilent \n7890 A gas chromatograph (GC) connected online. All the lines con-\nnecting the reactor with the GC were kept at 200\u25e6C to avoid product \nFig. 2.FEG-SEM images (a and b) and EDX mapping analysis (c) of M2 catalyst .  V. L\u2019hospital et al.

The GC was equipped with three channels: the first one \nconsisted of two series connected of HP PLOT 5A molecular sieve col-\numn (for H2 and CO) and a HP PLOT Q molecular sieve column (for CO2 \nand H2O) connected to a TCD detector, while the second channel con-\nsisted of a HP INNOWAX capillary column (for methanol) connected to a \nFID detector and finally the third channel consisted of a GS-Q capillary \ncolumn (for hydrocarbons) connected to another FID detector. \nThe CO conversion was calculated using the following equation \n(Eq.1): \nXCO(%)=FCO,in\u0000FCO,out\nFCO,in\u00d7100 (1)  \nwhere FCO,in and FCO,out are the molar inlet and outlet CO flows. \nThe selectivity to a product (i) is calculated by comparing the molar \nflow of the product (i) and the total amount of CO converted (Eq.2): \nSi=ni\u00d7 F i\nFCO,in\u0000 FCO,out\u00d7100 (2)  \nwhere ni and Fi are the carbon atom numbers in the product (i) and the \nmolar flow of the product (i). 3.Results and discussions \n3.1. M1 and M2 characterizations \n3.1.1. Morphological, textural and physicochemical properties of methanol \nsynthesis catalyst (M1) \nFEG-SEM images of the M1 commercial methanol synthesis catalyst \nare shown in Fig. 1. The morphology of catalyst M1 behaves like \nirregular particles. Fig. 1 shows the results of EDX elemental analysis of \nthe obtained M1 material. The oxygen, aluminum, copper, zinc, mag-\nnesium and carbon elements were detected. \nThe composition of the M1 commercial methanol catalyst was also \ndetermined by ICP-OES: the weight percentages of CuO, ZnO, Al2O3 and \nMgO are 55.3, 21.7, 7.8 and 1.1wt% (the missing 14.1 wt% corre -\nsponding to carbon and water), respectively (Table S3). \nThe BET surface area (SBET)and pore volume (Vexter) of the M1 \ncompound are approximately 97m2 g-1 and 0.20 cm3 g-1 (Table S3), \nrespectively. \nXRD patterns of fresh and reduced M1 are shown in Fig. S1. Fresh M1 \ncatalyst exhibit crystallized phases of CuO (tenorite structure), ZnO \n(zincite structure), (Cu0.8Zn0.2)2(OH) 2(CO 3) (zincian malachite struc-\nture) and carbon (graphitic structure). No phase containing Al2O3 or \nMgO was detected with XRD, due likely to amorph forms. After reduc -\ntion under H2 at 400\u25e6C, CuO is fully reduced to metallic copper whereas \nZnO stays in its zincite form. \nThe reducibility of M1 catalyst was also evaluated by H2-TPR. The \nTPR profile is shown in Fig. S2. This profile is characterized by the main \npeak centered at 241\u25e6C and ascribed to the reduction of CuO to metallic \nCu. The amount of H2 consumption (VH2) and the H2/Cu ratio are re-\nported in Table S3. According to the stoichiometry of the CuO reduction \n(CuO+H2\u2192Cu+H2O), the value of H2/Cu molar ratio, equal to one, \nFig. 3.Evolution of (a) the conversion and (b) the selectivity values and the P/ \nO ratio versus the number of contacts in LB arrangements at 15h of reaction. \nReaction conditions: m(M1+M2)=1.20 g, P=30bar, T=400\u25e6C, H2/CO/ \nAr=53/21/26, WHSV(xLB(y))=5L.h-1.g-1 and WHSV(for M1 alone)=10L.h- \n1.g-1 (the P/O ratio represents the proportion of paraffins relative to olefins). \nFig. 4.Evolution of the conversion (a) and evolution of the selectivity values \nand the P/O ratio (b) versus the M2 content in SRM arrangements at 15h of \nreaction.

L\u2019hospital et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n5indicates that 100% of copper is reduced to a metallic state under the \nreaction conditions, which is in accordance with the reduced M1 XRD \nmeasurement. \n3.1.2. Morphological and textural properties of SAPO-34 (M2) \nThe morphology of the M2 SAPO-34 commercial material is shown in \nFig. 2. The M2 grains behave like a stack of micro-scale cubes (Fig. 2a \nand b). This cubic morphology is characteristic of the chabazite \nstructure. \nFig. 2c shows the results of EDX elemental analysis of the M2 ma-\nterial. The oxygen, aluminum, silicon, and phosphorus elements were \ndetected. As can be seen, the distribution of the elements is very ho-\nmogenous on the surface of M2 sample. The composition of the M2 \nSAPO-34 commercial material, determined by ICP-OES, is 8.9, 34.1 and \n36.1 wt% (the missing 20.9 wt% corresponding to water) for SiO2, \nAl2O3 and P2O5, respectively (Table S4), with a Si/Al ratio equal to 0.22. \nThe XRD pattern, displayed in Fig. S3, shows the typical diffraction \npeaks assigned to the chabazite structure at 9.6, 13.2, 16.2, 20.8, 26.0, \nand 31.1\u25e6. The SBET surface area and the Vexter external pore volume of \nthe M2 are approximately 475m2 g-1 and 0.03 cm3 g-1 (Table S4). The \nSmicro surface area and the Vmicro micropore volume are 463m2 g-1 and \n0.23 cm3 g-1, respectively. \n3.2. Catalytic performances \n3.2.1. M1+M2 arrangements \n3.2.1.1. Catalytic performances with layered bed (LB) arrangements. The \nimpact of the contact concentration between M1 and M2 is investigated \nusing the different layered bed arrangements present in the Table S1. \nThe performance of M1 and different catalytic layered bed arrangements \nat 15h of reaction is shown in Fig. 3 (the evolution of the CO conversion \nand the product selectivities versus the time on stream is presented in \nFig. S4). The M1 catalyzed the conversion of syngas to CH4, CO2 and \nhydrocarbons (denoted HC, mostly C2H6) with selectivities of approxi -\nmately 45%, 40% and 10%, respectively. The CO conversion (denoted \nXCO) is approximately 7% (with WHSV=10L.h-1.g-1, see Fig. 3a); and methanol (denoted MeOH) and dimethylether (denoted DME) traces are \nobserved (Fig. 3b). These results clearly indicate that, under our \nexperimental conditions, M1 favors the methanation and Water Gas \nShift (WGS) reactions at the expense of methanol synthesis reaction, \nwhich is also in agreement with the thermodynamic equilibrium data \npresented in Table S5. No activity is observed for M2 alone (not pre-\nsented here). When the M2 catalyst is associated with the M1 catalyst, \nwithout contact (2LB(0) arrangement, where M1 and M2 are separated \nfrom each other by a 1cm thick layer of SiC), the CO conversion (Fig. 3a) \nand the CH4 and CO2 selectivities (Fig. 3b) are not changed compared to \nthe test with the M1 catalyst alone. However, the disappearance of \nMeOH and DME is observed in favor of hydrocarbons. When the both \ncatalysts are in contact (2LB(1), 4LB(3), 6LB(5), 8LB(7) and 10LB(9) \narrangements), an increase in CO conversion (Fig. 3a) and HC selectivity \n(mostly C3H8) and a decrease in CH4 selectivity are observed (Fig. 3b, \nthe CO2 selectivity is constant for all the catalytic tests). This phenom -\nenon is amplified with the increase in the number of contacts between \nM1 and M2 layers. The formation of hydrocarbons is explained by the \ntransformation of methanol intermediate formed over M1 into hydro -\ncarbons over M2 acid sites, thus inhibiting the CO methanation and/or \nthe hydrogenation of MeOH into CH4 over M1[13]. The intimacy be-\ntween both materials leads to a strong increase in the proportion of \nparaffins relative to olefins (see the P/O ratio in Fig. 3b), indicating the \nhydrogenation of the olefins. Hydrogen spillover (from M1 to M2) \nand/or olefins spillover (from M2 to M1) and/or the hydrogenation of \nolefins by crossing through a layer of M1 would probably explain this \n[14,15] . \nIt is possible to estimate the gain of CO conversion (denoted XCOgain ), \ninduced by the proximity between M1 and M2, by subtracting the CO \nconversion value of the xLB(y) catalyst (denoted XCO) with the value of \nM1 catalyst (denoted XCOM1), according with the following equation \nEq.3:  \nXCOgain =XCO - XCOM1                                                                   (3) \nwith XCOM1 =7%. \nThe XCOgain (see Fig. 3a) scales linearly with the number of contacts, \nwith an interception at zero. This result clearly evidences that the \nFig. 5.(a) two-dimensional multicomponent packing, (b) tetrahedral subunits (Orange and yellow spheres represent M1 and M2, respectively.), (c) evolution of \ncontact concentrations and (d) evolution of the normalized M1-M2 contact concentration and the normalized XCOgain of SRM versus M2 content (with \nrM1=rM2=65.0 \u00b5m, \u03c1M1=1.23gcm\u00003 and \u03c1M2=0.94gcm\u00003). V. L\u2019hospital et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n6XCOgain is directly correlated with the M1-M2 contact concentration. \nThis proximity eliminates restriction of methanol synthesis by the \nthermodynamic equilibrium shift and enhanced the CO conversion (and \ntherefore the production of HC). \n3.2.1.2. Catalytic performances with simple random mixture (SRM) \narrangements. In order to improve the CO conversion, different simple \nrandom mixtures of M1 and M2 were made. Different compositions of \nthese SRM arrangements were used to vary the contact concentration \nbetween M1 and M2. The same total amount of M1+M2 catalysts was \nused for each of SRM arrangement. The characteristics of SRM ar-\nrangements are presented in the Table S2. \nThe impact of the composition of the SRM arrangement at 15h of \nreaction is illustrated in Fig. 4 (the evolution of the CO conversion and \nthe product selectivities versus the time on stream is presented in \nFig. S5). The conversion of CO as a function of the M2 proportion pre-\nsents a volcano-type profile (Fig. 4a). No activity is observed for M2 and \nlittle for M1 (XCO=11.2% with WHSV=5L.h-1.g-1), while their combi -\nnation demonstrates synergy, with a maximal CO conversion \n(XCO=54.1%, which is much higher than the CO conversions obtained \nwith the LB arrangements) located around 50% of M2 proportion. When \nthe M2 proportion increases (see Fig. 4b), the HC (mostly C3H6) selec-\ntivity quickly increases (until a plateau around 50% of M2 content) at the expense of the CH4 selectivity while the CO2 selectivity is constant \nfor all the catalytic tests (\u224840%). The proportion of paraffins also \npresents a volcano-type profile with a maximum located around 50% of \nM2. \nWith the same approach as the LB arrangements, it is possible to \nestimate the gain of CO conversion (denoted XCOgain ), for each SRM \ncomposition (using Eq.3 with XCOM1 =xM1 \u00d711.2, where xM1 and 11.2 \nrepresent the M1 mass fraction (see Table S2) in the corresponding SRM \ncatalyst and the CO conversion of the M1 catalyst alone at WHSV=5L. \nh-1.g-1, respectively). The XCOgain for the SRM arrangements (see Fig. 4a) \npresents, also, a volcano-type profile with a maximum located around \n50% of M2. \nIn order to validate the M1\u2013M2 proximity hypothesis (directly \nobserved with the LB arrangements), it is necessary to answer this \nquestion: \u2018what is the influence of the SRM catalyst composition on the \nM1-M2 proximity responsible for CO conversion? \u2019. \n3.3. Sphere contact quantification model in randomly packed binary \nmixtures for SRM arrangement \nTo investigate whether the volcano-curve profile of the XCOgain , for \nthe SRM arrangements, can be explained by the number of contacts \nbetween M1 and M2 as postulated, it is necessary to quantify it in a \nFig. 6.(a) FEG-SEM image, (b) Cu (red) and P (yellow) EDX mapping analysis of reduced SRM(0.50) catalyst, Cu (red) and P (yellow) EDX mapping of the surface of \n(c) M1 and (d) M2 grains and (e) schematic representation of the reduced SRM(0.50) catalyst.

Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n7dense packing of randomly distributed binary spheres (simplified rep-\nresentation of the SRM arrangement in Fig. 5a with rM1=rM2, it was also \nassumed that the grain size of M1 and M2 did not change during the \nreduction) as well as in mixtures of different compositions, according \nwith the methodology used in our previous study to determine the \nconcentration of number of contacts between two materials [12]. With \nthe statistical and geometric approach of the Dodds model [16,17] , it is \npossible to easily describe the texture of a 3D polydisperse random \nmixture. The Dodds model assumes that each particle constituting the \npolydisperse mixture is in contact with all its neighbors. This basic hy-\npothesis allows to divide the space into tetrahedral subunits ijkl (i, j, k \nand l representing the indices of the species constituting the four vertices \nof a tetrahedron), containing a part of vacuum and each vertex being the \ncenter of a given particle. A binary random mixture (composed of 2 \nfamilies of type 1 and 2 particles, representing M1 and M2, respectively \nfor this study) has 5 types of tetrahedral subunits (1111, 1112, 1122, \n1222, and 2222, Fig. 5b). These different tetrahedral subunits are \ngeometrically fully characterized with the angles a, b and c at the \nsummit i, the spherical angles \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 and the area AT of the spherical \ntriangle (ABC) [18]. The geometry of such a tetrahedral subunit is \ncompletely described by the radii of the four spheres forming it (ri, rj, rk \net rj). By knowing the particles radii and their distributions in number, it \nis possible to determine coordination numbers, porosity, and distribu -\ntion of the different contact types in the polydisperse mixture. In the \nspirit of the Dodds model, model calculations were performed. A \nmathematical model was developed in order to determine the concen -\ntration of number of contacts between M1\u2013M1, M2\u2013M2, and M1\u2013M2 \n(denoted [NC11], [NC22], and [NC12] and expressed in number of \ncontacts per gram of catalyst) for any composition of the SRM catalyst \n(see Fig. 5c, all the details of the proposed model are presented in the \nsupporting information in the section \u201cDescription of the contact \nmodel \u201d). \nIn order to have a representative view of the impact of the M1-M2 contacts in the XCOgain , we compared the evolution of the normalized \nconcentration of number of contacts between M1\u2013M2 with the \nnormalized XCOgain as a function of the M2 proportion in the catalyst \n(Fig. 5d). It clearly appears that the obtained volcano curve for the \nconcentration of number of contacts between M1 and M2 with a \nmaximum at 50% M2 is identical to the one obtained for the normalized \nXCOgain . This result validates the contact \u2013reactivity relationship \nhypothesis. \n3.4. Reduced SRM arrangement structure and morphology \nWe observed that the CO conversion is dramatically affected by the \nSRM catalyst composition, and therefore by the amount of M1-M2 \ncontacts present in the hybrid materials. We investigated the structure \nand textural parameters for the best CO conversion catalyst (SRM(0.50)) \nto understand the nature of M1-M2 contacts. The XRD diffractogram at \nthe fresh plotted in Fig. S6a is a linear combination of the M1 and M2 \nones. After reduction, it corresponds to a combination of the diffracto -\ngram of reduced M1 and to the one of SAPO-34 for which the peaks are \nslightly shifted to the low angles (Fig. S6b). This shift could be due to \ncationic exchange within the zeotype. [19,20] The morphology of the \nreduced SRM(0.50) catalyst obtained by FEG-SEM measurements is \npresented in Fig. 6 (see also Fig. S7 in supporting Information for the \ncomplete EDX mapping analysis). The reduced catalyst behaves like a \ndense packing of randomly distributed binary grains with grain sizes \nsimilar to those of the fresh hybrid catalyst (Fig. 6a), which agrees with \nthe starting point of our theoretical model (Fig. 5a). In order to differ -\nentiate the nature of each catalyst grain, a mapping of the main char-\nacteristic elements of M1 and M2 (Cu (in red) and P (in yellow), \nrespectively) was carried out (Fig. 6b). It can be seen that, after the \nreduction, this granular mixture includes not only conventional contacts \nbetween the grains of M1 and M2 (as one might expect), but also a \ndecoration of the surface of the grains of M1 by microcubes of M2 (see \nFig. 7.(a) NH3-TPD profiles of M1, M2, LB and SRM arrangements (m(M1+M2)=0.250 mg) and M1+M2 represents a linear combination of the corresponding M1 \nand M2 NH3-TPD profiles) and (b) NH3-TPD subtraction profiles.

A generic \nstructure for reduced SRM catalysts is schematically presented in Fig. 6e. \nThese grain decorations optimize the intimacy between M1 and M2 \n(M1/M2 interphase) which is promote the elimination of the restriction \nof methanol synthesis by the thermodynamic equilibrium shift and \ntherefore increase of the CO conversion. \n3.5. Characterization of the M1-M2 contacts \nThe quantity of interphases between M1 and M2 can be determined, \nindirectly, using the properties of a Cu exchanged SAPO-34 synthesis \nmethod, generally used for the selective catalytic reduction with \nammonia (NH 3-SCR) [19]. This method, named solid-state ion-exchange \n(SSIE), consists in mixing copper oxide with SAPO-34 and heating it at low temperature (T<250\u25e6C) under an atmosphere of NH3, which leads \nto the diffusion of metal ions in the zeolite [19]. The mobility of Cu is \nproposed to be related to the formation of complexes [Cu(I)(NH 3)x]+\n(x\u22652). Indeed, these linear complexes have a diameter similar to that of \nan NH3 molecule, thus allowing these species to easily penetrate into the \nporous system of the zeolite and thus to improve the Cu exchange. One \ncan thus easily imagine that if one carries out this method with our \nmaterials (LB and SRM arrangements), the mobility of Cu should in-\ncrease with the concentration of contact between M1 and M2. The use of \nNH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH 3-TPD) on our materials \nallows not only to perform the SSIE process during the NH3 adsorption \nstep, but also to indirectly quantify the amount of Cu exchanged in M2 \n(and therefore a representation of M1-M2 contact concentration). \nFig. 7a shows the NH3-TPD profiles on LB and SRM arrangements \n(the dimensions of our NH3-TPD reactor did not allow us to perform the \nmeasurements for the 8LB(7) and 10LB(9) arrangements). These profiles \nare characterized by three desorption peaks: a low temperature (LT) \npeak at ~200\u25e6C (assigned to NH3 adsorbed to Lewis acid sites [21\u201327]), \nan intermediate temperature (IT) peak at 250\u2013350\u25e6C (corresponding to \nNH3 adsorbed on Cu-sites [21\u201325] created on the zeolite because Cu2+\ncations could exchange with the H+in zeolites partially, introducing \nsome cations to the framework [28,29] ) and a high temperature (HT) \npeak (>400\u25e6C, attributed to NH3 adsorbed on Br\u00f8nsted acid sites i.e. \nformation of NH4+[20\u201324]). NH3-TPD of reduced SRM(0.50) followed \nby DRIFT spectroscopy (Fig. S8) confirmed the presence of Lewis acid \nsites (bands at 3385 \u20133335, 3275, 1622, 1274 and 1219 cm-1) and \nBr\u00f8nsted acid sites (3270, 1490 \u20131450 cm-1) as well as NH3 adsorbed on \nCu+sites on SAPO-34 (3184 cm-1). A detailed attribution is provided in \nthe supporting information . \nIn order to better understand the shape of the LB and SRM ar-\nrangements NH3-TPD profiles, measurements were carried out on \ndifferent masses of M1 and M2 alone. From these new profiles, it was \npossible to simulate theoretical NH3-TPD profiles, corresponding to \nmixtures of M1+M2 without contacts (M1+M2(x), where x represents \nthe M2 content), using linear combination from the characteristic M1 \nand M2 profiles to the masses of the different LB and SRM arrangements \nused. The theoretical profiles obtained are shown in Fig. 7a. \nWhen the M2 catalyst is associated with the M1 catalyst without \ncontact, it is observed that the experimental profile of 2LB(0) is an exact \ncopy of the profile of M1+M2(0.50) simulated profile (the total acidity \nmeasured for 2LB(0) of 1230 \u00b5molg-1 is in perfect agreement with the \nvalue calculated for M1+M2(0.50) of 1238 \u00b5molg-1). When both cat-\nalysts are in contact (2LB(1), 4LB(3), 6LB(5) and SRM arrangements), \nthe experimental profiles are no in agreement with the simulated pro-\nfiles. An increase in the intensity of the IT peak (corresponding to NH3 \nadsorbed at Cu-sites) and an increase in the total acidity are observed, \nindicating a change in behavior linked to the migration of Cu within the \nzeolite. \nFig. 7b shows the results of subtractions between experimental \nprofiles (for the 2LB(1), 4LB(3), 6LB(5) and SRM arrangements) with the \ncorresponding simulated profiles. We observe not only the presence of \nthe peak at intermediate temperature at 340\u25e6C (IT1) but also the \nappearance of a new peak close to 400\u25e6C (IT2). As demonstrated by \nChen et al. [30], species that contribute to the IT1 and IT2 peaks could \nbe the decomposition of the [Cu(I)(NH 3)2]+and [Cu(II)(OH)(NH 3)3]+\ncomplexes, respectively. In order to have a representative view of the \neffect of the contact between M1 and M2 over the Cu migration, the total \nconcentration of both peaks (IT1 and IT2) versus the number of contacts \nin LB arrangements and versus the M2 content in SRM arrangements are \nshown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. It clearly appears that the evolu -\ntions of the concentration of new peaks are identical to those obtained \nfor XCOgain of LB and SRM arrangements (in Figs. 3a and 4a). The evo-\nlution of XCOgain obtained with the LB and SRM arrangements scales \nlinearly with the concentrations of new peaks, with an interception to \nzero (see Fig. 8c). This result clearly evidences that the NH3-TPD mea-\nsurements can be used to quantify contacts between M1 and M2 for one \nFig. 8.(a) Evolution of the new NH3-TPD peaks concentrations versus the \nnumber of contacts in LB arrangements and (b) versus the M2 content in SRM \narrangements, (c) Evolution of the XCOgain of the LB and SRM arrangements \nversus the new NH3-TPD peaks concentration.

When the SAPO-34 catalyst was associated with the Cu-ZnO- \nAl2O3 catalyst (LB arrangement), without contact, CO conversion has \nnot changed compared to the test with the M1 catalyst alone. However, \nthe disappearance of methanol and DME was observed in favor of hy-\ndrocarbons (with a significant selectivity toward CH4 and CO2). When \nboth catalysts were in contact (LB arrangement), an increase of CO \nconversion and HC selectivity and a decrease of CH4 selectivity were \nobserved. This phenomenon is amplified with the increase of the contact \nconcentration. In order to improve the CO conversion, different SRM of \nCu-ZnO-Al 2O3 and SAPO-34 were made. The impact of the composition \nof the SRM hybrid catalyst was investigated and shown a volcano-like \nprofile for CO conversion as a function of M2 content in the catalyst. \nTo elucidate the effect of composition on CO conversion a mathematical \nmodel for Cu-ZnO-Al 2O3 and SAPO-34 contact quantification, based on a \ngeometrical and statistical approach allowing the textural description of \na random polydisperse medium, was developed. The experimental re-\nsults were compared with theoretical calculations. A direct correlation \nwas found between theory and experiment. The density of contact be-\ntween Cu-ZnO-Al 2O3 and SAPO-34 was identified as the key factor for \nthe catalytic performances (contact-activity relationships). Finally, the \nknowledge of the contact morphology, determined by FEG-SEM, \nallowed proposing the NH3-TPD as the concentration of contact char-\nacterization method. \nDeclaration of Competing Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial \ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence \nthe work reported in this paper. \nAcknowledgments \nThe French National Research agency \u201cAgence Nationale de la \nRecherche \u201d (ANR) is acknowledged for the financial support of the INCH \nproject (ANR-17-CE07 \u20130011). \nAppendix A.Supporting information \nSupplementary data associated with this article can be found in the \nonline version at doi:10.1016/j.apcata.2022.118757 . \nReferences \n[1]M.

In the past few decades, there has\nbeen growing scienti\ufb01c consensus to devise the strategy for CO 2\ncapture, \ufb01xation, and recycling technologies to level off the atmo-spheric CO\n2concentration. Nature has its own CO 2\ufb01xation process\nwhich is extraordinarily selective in converting CO 2into organic\ncompounds. However, natural chemical transformation of CO 2is\nnot simply fast enough to cope with the increasing CO 2emission\nrate of the industrialized world. Chemical transformation of CO 2\nis not only about mitigating the global warming; rather it is aboutrecycling of the carbon, irreversibly relocated in the form of CO\n2\nfrom the ground by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natu-\nral gas. In the light of the \ufb01nite availability of fossil fuels, the pro-\nduction of commercially valuable chemicals and fuels from CO 2is a\npromising strategy to simultaneously tackle the two major prob-\nlems of the century, namely the global warming and fossil fuel\ndepletion, for sustainable development. Among others, heteroge-\nneous catalytic hydrogenation of CO 2bears a strong potential totreat large amount of CO 2in a short time, rendering it an important\nmean for CO 2conversion.\nMethanol (MeOH) can be synthesized from CO 2hydrogenation\nand is one of the most celebrated and widely suggested alterna-\ntives for chemical energy carrier [1,2] . It is an excellent fuel and\na key starting material of the important industrial reactions. The\nuse of methanol in fuel cells directly or indirectly as the source\nof hydrogen by a reforming reaction is well documented. Actively\ninvestigated hydrogen production by photocatalytic or electrocat-\nalytic water splitting powered by renewable (e.g. solar and wind)\nenergies can be regarded as future sources of hydrogen for CO 2\nhydrogenation [3,4] . In addition, fundamental chemical products\nlike ole\ufb01ns can be produced via a methanol-to-ole\ufb01n (MTO) pro-\ncess [5]and various organic compounds like dimethyl ether\n(DME), that is, a potential substitute of diesel oil for its better com-bustion performance [6], can be produced from methanol. The\ncommercially practiced processes of methanol synthesis from CO\nand CO\n2are operated at relatively low one-pass conversions and\nrequire separation and/or recycling of unconverted reactants to\nattain high conversions. Currently, the commercial methanol\nsynthesis processes are operated typically at about 50\u2013100 bar\nusing copper- and zinc-based catalysts [7]. Lowering the reaction\npressure is generally favoured because of the general perception\nof increased energy demands at high-pressure operation.

Besides, high-pressure approaches can\nfacilitate the reduction in reactor volume when reactants and/or\nproducts are compressive, reducing the plant area which conse-\nquently reduces capital costs, and possible improvements in han-\ndling dangerous chemicals such as hydrogen more safely when\nused in a small volume. Above all, such approaches may result in\nshifting equilibrium conversion and in the formation of unique\nphase and states of reaction mixture and catalysts, thus boosting\ncatalytic activity.\nThe \ufb01rst high-pressure methanol synthesis process was com-\nmercialized by BASF in 1923, operated at pressure of 250\u2013\n350 bar with a mixture of syngas with CO 2as reactants [9]. The\nuse of high pressure was necessary due to thermodynamics; de-\ncrease in temperature and increase in reaction pressure should fa-\nvour the methanol formation. As mentioned above, modern\nprocesses are operated at lower reaction pressures of ca. 50\u2013\n100 bar at comparably lower temperatures thanks to the highly ac-\ntive Cu\u2013Zn-based catalysts [10]. Related to CO 2hydrogenation,\nIpatieff and Monroe reported high-pressure study up to 412 bar\nover Cu/Al 2O3catalysts in a \ufb01xed bed reactor, which showed\nremarkable selectivity to methanol and high conversion of CO 2\n[11]. However, in their study, the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV),\nindicative of the productivity of the reaction, was very low (ca.\n1000 h/C01) to make the process practically viable.\nHerein, we report high-pressure (up to 360 bar) CO 2hydrogena-\ntion to methanol over co-precipitated Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3catalysts at\nhigh GHSV (>10,000 h/C01). Under speci\ufb01c reaction conditions with\nconventional methanol synthesis catalysts, we will show that one\ncan achieve close-to-full one-pass conversion of CO 2to methanol.\nFurthermore, DME and hydrocarbons production from methanol\ncan be directly incorporated or combined with the methanol syn-\nthesis process, outlining the high \ufb02exibility and versatility of the\nreported CO 2hydrogenation process.\n2. Experimental\n2.1. Materials\nCopper nitrate hexahydrate ( P98%, Alfa Aesar), zinc nitrate\nhexahydrate (98%, Sigma\u2013Aldrich), aluminium nitrate nonahydrate\n(P98%, Fluka), potassium hydroxide ( P85%, Sigma\u2013Aldrich), c-\nAl2O3(Bimodal, Alfa Aesar) and NH 4-ZSM-5 (SiO 2/Al2O3= 50/1, Alfa\nAesar) were used as received. Deionized water was used for cata-\nlyst synthesis. A commercial methanol synthesis catalyst was pur-\nchased from Alfa Aesar (Product ID: 45776). Liquid CO 2\n(>99.9993%) and 10% Ar in H 2(>99.999% for Ar or H 2, prior to mix-\ning) were purchased from Linde.\n2.2. Catalyst synthesis\nFor the synthesis of Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3, aqueous solutions of copper\nnitrate hexahydrate (0.2 M), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.2 M) and\naluminium nitrate nonahydrate (0.2 M) with potassium hydroxide\n(0.5 M) were slowly added together, in a round-bottom \ufb02ask to\nprecipitate the corresponding hydroxides. During the precipitation,\nthe round-bottom \ufb02ask was heated at 80 /C176C under constant stir-\nring, and the pH of the solution with precipitate was maintained\nbetween 9.5 and 10.5. The precipitate was aged for 48 h, \ufb01ltered\nand washed with water until the pH of the washed solution\nreached the value of 7.5. Then, the sample was dried at 100 /C176C\novernight, crushed and calcined in air at 400 /C176C for 4 h to yield\nCu/ZnO/Al 2O3(I). Following the same synthesis procedure, twomore catalysts, Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(II) and Cu/Al 2O3, were prepared\nusing different compositions of precursor solutions. H-ZSM-5 was\nprepared by calcination of NH 4-ZSM-5 in air at 400 /C176C for 4 h. An-\nother Cu/Al 2O3(18/82 wt%) catalyst was prepared by the incipient\nwetness impregnation method. The preparation method and cata-\nlyst properties are described elsewhere [12]. Prior to charging the\ncatalysts into reactor, they were pelletized, crushed and sieved a\nsize of 100\u2013300 lm. Elemental composition, Cu surface area, CuO\ncrystallite size and BET surface area of the synthesized and com-\nmercial catalysts are listed in Table S1 (Supplementary material ).\n2.3. Catalytic testing\nCO2hydrogenation reaction was performed in the microreac-\ntion set-up and tubular reactors (ID: 1.74 mm, OD: 3.17 mm) were\nused throughout. Details of the set-up and method of product anal-\nysis are described elsewhere [12]. For methanol synthesis, 170 mg\nof Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(I) was used. In the study of very low to high\nGHSVs using the commercial catalyst, 1000, 85 or 42.5 mg of the\ncatalyst was used for the catalytic tests in the range of 425,\n10,000\u201340,000 or 81,000\u2013182,000 h/C01, respectively.\nFor the synthesis of DME, H-ZSM-5 (150 mg) was mixed with\nCu/ZnO/Al 2O3(II) (170 mg) and charged into one reactor or the\ntwo catalysts were charged separately into two reactors connected\nin series.\nFor hydrocarbon synthesis, H-ZSM-5 (170 mg) was charged into\na reactor connected in series after that containing Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3\n(II) for methanol synthesis. The temperature of the secondary reac-tor containing H-ZSM-5 was controlled independently from the\n\ufb01rst one. For alkane synthesis, the reactor with H-ZSM-5 wasplaced before the back pressure regulator, thus kept at the same\npressure as the \ufb01rst one ( Fig. S8 ). While in alkene synthesis, the\nsecondary reactor was located after the back pressure regulator\n(Fig. S9 ) and kept at the atmospheric pressure. It should be noted\nthat GHSVs for the combined processes (DME and hydrocarbon\nsyntheses) were calculated based on the amount of the methanol\nsynthesis catalyst in the reactor.\nFor the above three reactions, argon was used as an internal\nstandard for gas chromatography (GC) analysis and product selec-\ntivity was calculated taking only carbon-containing products into\naccount.\n3.

Reaction conditions: T= 260 /C176C, P= 360 bar,\nGHSV = 10,471 h/C01.A. Bansode, A. Urakawa / Journal of Catalysis 309 (2014) 66\u201370 67at 260 /C176C, 360 bar, and GHSV of 10,471 h/C01. At the conventional\nCO2/H2molar ratio of 1:3 de\ufb01ned by the stoichiometry of CO 2\nhydrogenation to methanol, CO 2conversion was 37% with 72%\nmethanol selectivity. Drastic rise in both values was observed\nwhen H 2partial pressure was further increased to CO 2/H2= 1:10.\nAt this ratio, CO 2conversion was outstanding (95%) with high\nmethanol selectivity (98%), suppressing CO formation to a negligi-\nble extent. Under this condition, the methanol weight time yield\n(WTY) was found to be 1 :2gMeOH g/C01\ncath/C01.\nTheoretical equilibrium conversion values for CO 2and H 2at\nvarious CO 2/H2ratios under this reaction condition ( Supplemen-\ntary material, Fig. S1 ) show interesting insights of the catalytic per-\nformance. It is worth highlighting that the equilibrium conversion\nis very high (>94%) even when the mixture is at the stoichiometric\nratio (CO 2/H2= 1:3, Fig. S1 ) under the high-pressure condition.\nExperimentally at CO 2/H2= 1:<10, the conversion values are far\nfrom the equilibrium values, while at 1: P10 the values are almost\nidentical to those expected from the equilibrium ( Fig. 1 vs.S1). The\nWTYs were smaller at the high H 2partial pressures due to lower\nCO2mass \ufb02ow at the constant GHSV ( Table S2 ). The results indicate\nthat at the feed ratio of 1: P10, the process operates in the thermo-\ndynamic regime reaching the equilibrium CO 2conversion and\nmethanol selectivity under the investigated condition, whereas at\nthe feed ratio of 1:<10, the reaction falls into the kinetic regime.\nJudging from the similar theoretical equilibrium conversion at\nthe different CO 2/H2ratios, the experimentally observed outstand-\ning CO 2conversion and methanol selectivity at high H 2partial\npressure (i.e. CO 2/H2=1 :P10) are most likely due to the rate accel-\neration for methanol formation by the high H 2partial pressure. Be-\nsides, the H 2conversion was observed to be decreasing with the\nincrease in H 2partial pressure, as expected from the excess of H 2\nrelative to CO 2. However, it should be noted that the energy ef\ufb01-\nciency towards methanol formation was greatly enhanced at\nCO2/H2=1 :P10 because of the suppressed, competitive reverse\nwater\u2013gas shift (RWGS; CO 2+H 2?CO + H 2O) reaction. The H 2\nconsumption rate at conventional feed ratio of 1:3 was found to\nbe 88 mmol g/C01\ncath/C01towards methanol and 11 mmol g/C01\ncath/C01to-\nwards CO formation, whereas at 1:10, it was 110 mmol g/C01\ncath/C01\nand almost exclusively used for the production of methanol. This\nis an important fact in practice because at high H 2partial pressure\nthe energy (incl. hydrogen molecules as chemical energy) and time\n(thus for better yield) required for methanol production are mini-\nmized and solely used for methanol synthesis. Also, we demon-\nstrated the documented analogies of high-pressure advantages\nbetween methanol synthesis and classic Haber\u2013Bosch ammonia\nsynthesis processes by achieving the equilibrium yield [13].Fig. 2 depicts the effects of temperature on the catalytic perfor-\nmance at 360 bar, CO 2/H2= 1:10, and GHSV of 10,471 h/C01. A rise in\ntemperature greatly enhanced CO 2conversion, reaching the maxi-\nmum at 260 /C176C with the aforementioned outstanding methanol\nproductivity. Further rise in temperature resulted in methanol\nselectivity decrease and in apparent compensating increase in CO\nformation. At a lower pressure of 200 bar, a similar trend with a\nmaximum in the catalytic performance at 280 /C176C was observed\n(XCO2= 79%, S MeOH = 88%, Fig. S4 ). This great enhancement in meth-\nanol selectivity upon temperature increase is surprising at \ufb01rst\nglance because the competitive RWGS reaction is an endothermic\nreaction and higher temperature should facilitate the reaction with\nrespect to methanol synthesis that is an exothermic reaction and\npreferable at lower temperature [10,14] .\nComparing the obtained results to the thermodynamic calcula-\ntions ( Figs. S2 and S3 ), above 260 /C176C the reaction reaches close to\nthe equilibrium conversion, hence falling into thermodynamic re-\ngime. This thermodynamic control can be clearly con\ufb01rmed by\nreproduction of the trend for the unexpected decrease in CO 2con-\nversion above 260 /C176C, accompanying decrease in methanol selec-\ntivity ( Fig. 2 vs.S2 and S3 ). On the other hand, below 260 /C176C the\nCO2conversion was far from equilibrium and the enhanced meth-\nanol selectivity towards higher temperature up to 260 /C176C can be re-\ngarded due to the kinetic control. When the reaction is kinetically\ncontrolled, the high selectivity to CO is more pronounced ( Fig. 2 )a s\nobserved for the aforementioned kinetically controlled regime\n(Fig. 1 )a tC O 2/H2= 1:<10. This observation suggests that the CO 2\nhydrogenation to methanol proceeds via CO.\nIt is intriguing to notice that with the Cu/Al 2O3catalyst pre-\npared by the impregnation route, the formation of products was\nobserved to be in accordance with the thermodynamic principles,\ni.e. better methanol selectivity at lower temperatures and higher\nCO selectivity and higher CO 2conversion at higher temperatures,\nbut with overall poor catalytic performance very far from the equi-\nlibrium ( Table S3 ). There may be some differences in the nature of\nactive sites of the catalysts prepared by the impregnation and co-\nprecipitation routes. Also, the boosting in catalytic performance\nwith a maximum at a speci\ufb01c temperature was not observed with\nthe Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3catalyst at the conventional CO 2/H2ratio of 1:3\n(Fig. S5 ). The absence of the maximum is likely due to the kinetic\ncontrol by the poorer catalytic performance at the lower H 2partial\npressure as evidenced by the higher CO selectivity ( Fig. S5 ).\nIpatieff and Monroe reported that under high-pressure condi-\ntions, CO 2is \ufb01rst reduced to CO via the RWGS reaction accompany-\ning the formation of water, and subsequently to formaldehyde as a\nsecondary reaction. The formed formaldehyde was suggested to be\nfurther reduced to methanol via two pathways: one via direct\nhydrogenation and the other via Cannizzaro reaction [11].I ti s\nwidely accepted that methanol is directly formed from CO 2rather\nthan CO [15\u201317] ; however, this may be applicable to reactions at\nlow or moderate pressures. In context with such high pressure\nand with obtained high conversions, the pathway for methanol for-\nmation via CO, suggested by Ipatieff and Monroe, is indeed in\naccordance with our observation. The high selectivity to CO at low-\ner temperatures can be explained by the slow secondary reaction\nof CO towards the formation of methanol. Likely, this secondary\nreaction is accelerated by increasing temperature, particularly at\nhigh pressure, and also the amount of methanol is greatly en-\nhanced due to the increased amount of CO produced by the endo-\nthermic RWGS reaction.\nIn addition, the formed water may promote CO hydrogenation\nas reported in literature [18]. As mentioned previously without\nmechanistic studies or operando observation of active sites and\nspecies, which is out of scope of the current investigation, this\nstudy points that CO 2hydrogenation to methanol proceeds via\nCO formation under high-pressure conditions.

Effect of temperature on CO 2conversion (X CO2), H 2conversion (X H2) and\nselectivity to CO (S CO) and methanol (S MeOH ) over the Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(I) catalyst.\nReaction conditions: P= 360 bar, GHSV = 10,471 h/C01,C O 2/H2= 1:10.68 A. Bansode, A. Urakawa / Journal of Catalysis 309 (2014) 66\u201370by Bennekom et al. on methanol synthesis from CO-rich or CO 2-\nrich syngas showed that >90% CO 2conversion and high selectivity\nto methanol could be achieved at speci\ufb01c conditions (e.g. 200 bar\nand 210 /C176C) due to phase separation of products (methanol and\nwater) by condensation, thus unlimiting the one-phase equilib-\nrium conversion [19]. One possible explanation of the high cata-\nlytic performance of this work may also be due to a similar\nphase separation; however, the study by Bennekom et al. showed\nmarked lowering of CO 2conversion in the temperature range re-\nported to be optimal from this work and thus only phase behaviour\ncannot explain the high catalytic performance and rather thermo-\ndynamics and rate enhancement at high H 2pressure more likely\nplay decisive roles under the conditions of this work.\nFor Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(I), methanol selectivity against CO selectivity\nwas the best at 10,471 h/C01, compared to a lower (5000 h/C01) and a\nhigher (20,000 h/C01) GHSVs ( Table S5 ). The results at 5000 h/C01may\nbe due to a side reaction started to be operative at the very long\ncontact time of the product (methanol) with the catalyst, as evi-\ndenced by the higher production of DME. At the increased GHSV\nof 20,000 h/C01, the WTY for methanol was found to be\n1:99 gMeOH g/C01\ncath/C01, proving that the investigated process is able\nto maintain high methanol productivity while retaining higher le-vel of conversion and methanol selectivity under at increased\nGHSV conditions.\nMoreover, the commercial methanol synthesis catalyst was also\ntested under similar reaction conditions. Excellent catalytic perfor-\nmance similar to that shown in Figs. 1 and 2 was con\ufb01rmed. The\ncatalyst was highly productive in methanol synthesis and WTY of\n7:7gMeOH was obtained at a very high GHSV of 182,000 h/C01\n(Table S6 ) with 65.8% CO 2conversion and 77.3% methanol selectiv-\nity. This WTY is superior to any values reported to date for one-\npass yield of methanol via CO 2hydrogenation, con\ufb01rming the gen-\neral applicability and practical relevance of the \ufb01nding. Increased\nCO selectivity at higher GHSVs again suggests the previously dis-\ncussed reaction pathway to produce methanol via CO. The sidereaction observed for Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(I) also took place over the\ncommercial catalyst at the very low GHSV of 425 h/C01, in this case\ntowards methane formation ( Table S6 ). These results point out that\nthere is an optimal GHSV for methanol productivity and selectivity\nin practice.\nFurthermore, with the optimal conditions of CO 2/H2ratio, pres-\nsure and space velocity, we examined the performance of the co-\nprecipitated Cu/Al 2O3catalyst without the Zn component. Good le-\nvel of CO 2conversion (82%) with high methanol selectivity (92%)\nwas obtained at 280 /C176C(Fig. S6 ). This observation reveals that the\noutstanding catalytic performance is related mainly to the high\npressure, to the feed composition and also to the synthesis method\nof the catalyst, thus to the speci\ufb01c state of Cu in the catalysts pre-\npared by the co-precipitation route [20]. The promoting effect of\nCu\u2013Zn combination is recognized but subtly pronounced underthe high-pressure condition of this work. Moreover, the catalytic\nperformance of Cu/ZnO/Al\n2O3was stable under the optimal condi-\ntion or under varying conditions of the CO 2/H2feed ratio for 128 h\n(Table S4 ).\nThe use of bi-functional catalysts for one-step DME production\nfrom CO 2is widely known [2,21] , and solid acid catalysts such as c-\nalumina, H-ZSM-5 and Na-H-ZSM-5 have been used in combina-\ntion with methanol synthesis catalysts to add the secondary func-\ntion [22]. Stimulated by the results obtained for methanol\nsynthesis, we evaluated one-step conversion of CO 2into DME via\nin situ conversion of methanol using physically mixed pre-pellet-\nized Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(II) and H-ZSM-5 catalysts ( Fig. 3 ). To our great\npositive surprise, the reaction conditions productive and selective\nfor methanol synthesis were also suited for one-step DME synthe-\nsis. Despite the presence of H-ZSM-5 catalyst in a physically mixed\nstate, the catalytic system exhibited similar levels of CO 2conver-\nsion as in methanol synthesis. DME selectivity remained always\nabove 80% starting from the lowest examined temperature and\nwas the highest (89%) at 300 /C176C, retaining or even slightly boosting\nCO2conversion (97% at 280 /C176C). At 280 and 300 /C176C, the rest prod-\nucts were mainly methanol with traces of CO (<0.3%). This reaction\ncan also be operated by separating two catalysts into respective\nreactors connected in series and a similar performance as with\nthe physically mixed bed could be achieved ( Fig. S7 ).\nFinally, we conducted experiment towards the synthesis of al-\nkanes and alkenes from the obtained methanol using the same cat-\nalysts without any puri\ufb01cation step by changing reactor\ncon\ufb01gurations. First, we placed the Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(II) and H-ZSM-\n5 catalysts in series in respective tubular reactors maintained at\ndifferent temperatures at the same pressure ( Fig. S8 ).Table 1 ,\nexperiment no. 1 illustrates the CO 2conversion and product distri-\nbution when the reactor packed with Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(II) was kept at\n260/C176C while that of H-ZSM-5 was kept at 375 /C176C, 360 bar. The\ndominant products were hydrocarbons ranging from C 1to C 4, i.e.\nethane (20%), propane (24%) and isobutane (26%). The overall\nhydrocarbon selectivity was found to be 85%. The hydrogenation\nactivity towards alkanes was apparently enhanced under the pres-\nsurized conditions since the ef\ufb02uent of methanol synthesis reactor\nwas H 2-rich.

Conclusion\nThe catalytic system described in this work provides an ef\ufb01cient\nand highly productive processing strategy for CO 2conversion at a\nsingle step. The high-pressure approach using a conventional Cu/\nZnO/Al 2O3methanol synthesis catalyst under speci\ufb01c reaction con-\nditions for CO 2hydrogenation remarkably boosted methanol selec-\ntivity and productivity by (i) the high H 2partial pressure to\nenhance the reaction rate and (ii) thermodynamically favoured\nhigh CO 2conversion and methanol selectivity at high pressure.\nThe preliminary experiments with the commercial catalyst showed\nextraordinary high methanol productivity at very high GHSVs, pos-\nsibly justifying the capital and manufacturing costs of high-pres-\nsure processes. Negligible pressure drops under the examined\nGHSVs are the advantage of compressive reactants at high pres-\nsure. The consumed hydrogen was exclusively utilized for metha-\nnol formation at increased hydrogen partial pressure, thereby\nincreasing the ef\ufb01ciency of the process towards methanol synthe-\nsis by suppressing chemical and thermal energy consumption for\nRWGS reaction. Moreover, the excess of hydrogen remaining instream present under the optimal reaction condition reported in\nthis work can be fed directly to another identical or multiples of\nhigh-pressure reactors with possible reduction in their sizes, so\nthat compression of hydrogen may only require at initial stage\nwhereas methanol productivity would be multiples of connected\nreactors. In such con\ufb01gurations, the recycling of H\n2can be mini-\nmized or potentially omitted.\nOne-step transformation of CO 2to DME by the co-presence of\nthe H-ZSM-5 catalyst showed remarkable ability of this process\nwithout lowering the CO 2conversion level. Also, the methanol-,\nwater- and H 2-rich stream can be directly fed to the reactor con-\ntaining the H-ZSM-5 catalyst and good selectivity to alkane or al-\nkene was attained, instigating further development of CO 2to\nole\ufb01ns and/or gasoline processes via one-step hydrogenation. The\nCO2transformation approach presented in this study may allowthe convenient operation of small scale yet highly productive\nplants for CO 2hydrogenation at sites where CO 2is captured and\nstored.\nAcknowledgments\nFinancial support from the ICIQ foundation and MINECO\n(CTQ2012-34153) is greatly acknowledged.

Methanol, the simplest of\nalcohols, is found in nature in small amounts including interstellar space and nature on earth, where it is produced by anaerobe metabo-\nlism. Humans made methanol by pyrolysis or destructive distillation of wood for hundreds and even thousands of years before the last\ncentury where it became an industrial commodity and it is now produced in more than 13 l/year for each person on earth. The installed\nproduction capacity of methanol is around 110 million tons per year (MTY) [1], while the demand for methanol was approximately 80\u201390\nmillion tons in 2018. The requirement for methanol in 2023 is forecasted to exceed 110 MTY and is expected to outgrow the production\ncapacity. Today, methanol is manufactured from fossil fuels, but methanol can also be made from renewable energy resources. Methanol\nhas for that reason been suggested as the base molecule in a methanol economy as opposed to a hydrogen economy [2]and in this way\nmethanol may support the development of energy solutions with reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe applications of methanol are very diversi\ufb01ed: It is used to make a large series of chemical products including formaldehyde,\ndimethyl ether (DME), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME), acetic acid, dimethyl terephthalate, methyl chloride,\nand ole\ufb01ns via the methanol to ole\ufb01ns/propene (MTO/MTP) process. These chemicals are subsequently applied to make a wide range of\neveryday products including fuel additives, resins, plastics, paints, polyester, and building materials. Methanol is also used as a clean burn-\ning biodegradable fuel for vehicles, mainly for fuel blending, and to make high octane gasoline by the methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) or TIGAS\n(Topsoe Improved Gasoline Synthesis) processes. It is proposed as an alternative low sulfur marine fuel with low particulate emissions in\nnear coastal areas from 2020, when the MARPOL legislation becomes effective. There is currently a strong growth in the demand for metha-nol of approximately 6% per year, mainly driven by an increasing demand for ole\ufb01ns made by MTO/MTP and fuel blending especially in\nChina.\n2. Methanol synthesis technology\nThe technology for methanol production is well established (see Fig. 1 ) and improvements of both the synthesis technology and the\ncatalyst have for many years been incremental. The main raw materials for manufacture of methanol are natural gas and coal, but gasi\ufb01-\ncation of waste or biomass or the use of CO\n2and H 2O (to prepare H 2by electrolysis) may gain importance in the next couple of decades,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.002\n0021-9517/ /C2112019 Elsevier Inc.

Synthesis gas consists of CO, CO 2, and H 2, and considering the stoichiom-\netry for making methanol, the ideal module (M methanol ) for producing methanol should be close to two:\nMmethanol \u00bcH2/C0CO2\nCO\u00feCO2/C252\nFormation of methanol from synthesis gas proceeds via reactions (1)\u2013(3) and is exothermic and therefore cooling is needed, either by (i)\nboiling water or gas in cooled reactors or by interstage cooling between a series of adiabatic reactors using (ii) heat exchangers or (iii) addi-\ntion of quench gas. The equilibrium conversion that can be obtained in a single pass over the reactor depends on temperatures and pres-\nsures as depicted in Fig. 2 . The effective overall conversion of CO and CO 2in the synthesis gas to methanol is close to 100% due to the gas\nrecycle.\nCO\u00fe2H2\u00a2CH 3OHDH0\nR\u00bc/C089 kJ mol/C01\u00f01\u00de\nCO2\u00fe3H3\u00a2CH 3OH\u00feH2ODH0\nR\u00bc/C048 kJ mol/C01\u00f02\u00de\nCO\u00feH2O\u00a2CO2\u00feH2DH0\nR\u00bc/C041 kJ mol/C01\u00f03\u00de\nEven though industrial methanol synthesis catalysts are highly selective, selectivity is an issue especially for adiabatic reactors with\nethanol as the largest byproduct [3]. The formation of minor amounts of the byproducts acetone and methyl ethyl ketone is unwanted\nbecause they are dif\ufb01cult to remove by distillation.\nThe technology suppliers strive to make cheaper and more ef\ufb01cient methanol plants. The reforming or gasi\ufb01cation sections are crucial in\nthis work because these sections represent the main part of the construction and operation costs. One path to improve the ef\ufb01ciency of\nindustrial plants is to increase size and take advantage of the economy of scale and there is indeed a trend for building new highly ef\ufb01cient\nworld-class methanol plants with production capacities of up to 10.000 tons per day in areas with cheap feedstocks, mainly natural gas [3].\nLarge scale plants are predicted to be in service for decades, where the importance of CO 2reductions and minimization of the water con-\nsumption are expected to grow through customer requests and systems such as the EU emission trading scheme (ETS) and anti-\ufb02aring leg-\nislations. Future demands will therefore not only be the classic operation ef\ufb01ciency, but also the ability to use CO 2waste streams, CO 2\nrecovery or sequestration, increased use of renewable electricity or other steps that reduce climate and ecological footprints.\nMethanol may play an important role in a CO 2neutral future by assisting with the implementation of the goals in the Paris Climate\nAgreement. A high energy density energy carrier is most probably needed for some applications such as aviation, where energy densities\nof batteries are too low. Methanol has a reasonably high energy density of 15.6 MJ/l compared with 24 MJ/l for ethanol and 33 MJ/l for\ngasoline and can be produced from synthesis gas derived from gasi\ufb01cation of biomass or biomass fermentation to methane followed byRef or m in g\nPR/ SR/ ATR\nGasificationPreparation of\nsynt hesis gas Syn t h esis\ntec hnolog iesDistillation\ntec hnolog ies\nBoiling water\nreactorSi n gl e\ncolumn\n2 columns \n3 columnsNatural- & \nCoking gas\nEl ect r o l ysi sAdiabatic\nreactors\nGrade\nAAFu el\ngrade\nMT O \nGradeCoal &\nPet coke\nCO2&\nH2OS olid waste/biomassFeedst ock Methanol \npurity\nGas cooled \nreactor\nFig. 1.

Methanol is readily prepared from CO 2waste streams or in the future even CO 2extraction from air, when combined with\nhydrogen prepared by electrolysis of water using electricity from renewable resources such as solar, wind, or hydroelectric energy. One of\nthe main challenges when preparing electricity from solar panels or wind mills is the \ufb02uctuating nature of these energy sources. Prepara-\ntion of hydrogen by electrolysis of water and conversion into methanol is one answer to this challenge. Nevertheless, methanol prepared by\nthis technology is at present considerably more expensive than methanol made from fossil resources and also strongly dependent on the\nprice of renewable electricity.\nInterestingly, the demand for lowering CO 2emissions and anti-\ufb02aring regulations support another trend in the methanol market,\nnamely the desire to build small-scale plants near the end-user, using local (renewable) resources or small \ufb01elds of associated gas, which\nalso imply shorter transport of the methanol product. It is dif\ufb01cult for this market segment to really take off unless there is a pressure from\ngovernments to avoid \ufb02aring or/and reduce CO 2emissions. An opportunity for this technology could be mass production of small methanol\nplants through modulization and process simpli\ufb01cations that will bring the price of the decentralized methanol production down, even\nthough competition with modern large-scale plants bene\ufb01tting from current low gas prices seems unrealistic without an active taxation\nor regulation policy. The trend towards small plants may compel the synthesis to change as high pressures, large recycle streams, and com-\nplex feed and product puri\ufb01cation are expensive unit operations, where cost reductions and process integrations and simpli\ufb01cations are\nneeded.\n3. Interplay between methanol catalyst and technology\nIndustrial methanol synthesis catalysts applied today operate at 200\u2013300 /C176C and 50\u2013100 bar total pressure and consist of Cu as the\nactive metal, Al 2O3and ZnO to disperse Cu nano-particles and ZnO to assist Cu in making methanol (promotor). A series of additional pro-\nmotors such as Cr, Mg, Ca, Si, and Zr are often applied. This type of catalyst formulation was originally invented by ICI in the 1960s and has\nundergone important, but incremental improvements over the last \ufb01ve decades, and we are so far stuck with the advantages and disad-\nvantages of this chemical system.\nFrom an industrial point of view, methanol catalysts should ful\ufb01ll several requirements: The ideal methanol catalyst should have low\npressure drop and only moderate diffusion restrictions by choosing the right pellet size and shape, a high pellet strength to ensure mechan-\nical stability during loading and operation and it should also be possible to produce industrially in hundreds of tons with reasonable cost\nand ecological footprint. These requirements are challenges that are mainly addressed by industry today, but new potential catalysts devel-\noped by academia must eventually ful\ufb01ll the above requirements. The perfect methanol catalyst should also have decent activity and selec-\ntivity, high thermal stability, and good resistance towards poisons such as sulfur, chlorine, nickel/iron carbonyls, etc. These are all\nimportant scienti\ufb01c challenges to academia and subjects where new fundamental understanding may impact industrial practice. Activities\nof methanol synthesis catalysts and understanding of reaction mechanisms and promotor effects have received the majority of the atten-\ntion in the scienti\ufb01c literature. Selectivity, poisoning, and thermal stability of methanol synthesis catalysts are less discussed even though\nthere are excellent articles on these subjects [4\u201310] . Academia could provide more understanding of the mechanisms of poisoning (resis-\ntant) processes, catalyst stability, and synthesis of byproducts.\nThe developments towards large-scale plants, more CO 2rich feeds, waste gas streams, small-scale plants, and variable feed availability,\nbring new challenges to the scienti\ufb01c and industrial communities. One or more of the synthesis gas components in plants making use of\nrenewable feedstocks like CO 2waste streams and electrolysis are in general supplied at low pressure, and the cost of pressurizing to stan-\ndard synthesis pressures of 50\u2013100 bar is high. There is a wish to make methanol at lower pressures than today and thereby reduce both\ninvestment and operational costs, but this will come at a price of lower equilibrium conversions of the synthesis gas in a single pass of the\nreactor as depicted in Fig. 2 . One of the strongest desires in the methanol industry is development of methanol synthesis catalysts (and\nprocesses) that are able to operate at conditions where the conversion per pass of the methanol reactor is signi\ufb01cantly higher or even\nto make a once-through methanol synthesis process. It is possible to increase the conversion of one reactor pass by decreasing the tem-\nperature, but diminishing reaction rates over the present methanol catalysts at low temperatures now limit the temperatures to approx-\nimately /C21200/C176C. Making methanol catalysts more active at low temperatures could be an important improvement especially in small\nplants as lower pressures may reduce the price of the compression section considerably. Yet, the progress made so far has been limited.\nThis is most certainly due to interdependencies of the changes in thermodynamic properties of metals that are best illustrated by the\nso-called scaling relations where adsorption energies and reaction barriers scale simultaneously with fundamental descriptors such as oxy-\ngen and carbon adsorption energies [11]. Breaking these relations, for example, by using oxides/carbides or nitrides instead of metals is a\nmajor challenge to science, but also a direction to possible improvements in a heavily-explored scienti\ufb01c \ufb01eld.\nThe dream of nearly full conversion in a single reactor pass may also be obtained by breaking the thermodynamic limitations of the gas\nphase equilibrium for making methanol using a condensing methanol reactor. CO xand H 2are converted to condensing methanol in this\ntype of reactor, thereby eliminating methanol from the gas phase. The process is not commercial yet, although >95% conversion can be\nobtained in a single pass, but this approach holds an interesting perspective [12].\nCatalysts with higher capacities towards poisons or even catalysts tolerating poisons such as sulfur [10] would be highly interesting.\nSuch improvements would allow us to mitigate current challenges with poisons, handle new poisons, simplify and reduce cost of\n(small-scale) plants, and thus help us making methanol more ef\ufb01ciently. Today, typical impurities like sulfur, nickel, and iron are generally\nhandled in the puri\ufb01cation section with hydrogenation catalysts and absorbents as well as by avoiding metal dusting and making sure that\nthe plant is clean before start-up. Nevertheless, the production of many plants is still in\ufb02uenced by in principle preventable poisoning, so\nef\ufb01cient handling of this issue is still important. Applications of alternative gas feeds with impurities that are not normally encountered in\nconventional plants, combined with the demand for simplicity of small plants, makes it desirable to make improvements in this area [13].\nThe lifetime of methanol catalysts in industry is generally 2\u20134 years, when impurities are under control, but the activity of the catalysts\ndrops during this time span even in the absence of catalyst poisons [3,5,6,7,14] . Methanol plants usually counteract catalyst deactivation by\nadjustments of the synthesis pressure, recycle \ufb02ow, and/or synthesis temperature to maintain the productivity of the plant although these\nactions result in an increase in energy consumption.\nOne of the dreams in methanol synthesis is to make a more stable methanol synthesis catalyst and to avoid or reduce thermal deacti-\nvation during the industrial lifecycle. Sintering of methanol synthesis catalysts is complicated as it is not just Cu particles, but also ZnO and370 J. Sehested / Journal of Catalysis 371 (2019) 368\u2013375Al2O3particles that grow in size, and this may directly in\ufb02uence activity [15]. Detailed deactivation studies show a signi\ufb01cant restructuring\nof the catalyst [5,6] . Plants for making methanol from CO 2/H2gas mixtures are successfully designed with today\u2019s technology. However,\nmaking CO 2the primary carbon source of methanol increases steam partial pressures in the synthesis and tends to increase catalyst sin-\ntering. This is illustrated by the fact that Cu catalysts in general have lower Cu surface areas after exposure to low-temperature water gas\nshift conditions as compared with after methanol synthesis. It is therefore desirable to focus on thermal stability of methanol catalysts in\ngeneral and especially in CO 2to methanol applications, where the conditions are more challenging than when today \u00b4s more CO rich feeds\nare employed. Academia can play an important role in providing understanding and ideas for new and more durable methanol catalysts.\nThe CO 2conversion to methanol can also be improved by catalysts that only catalyze methanol synthesis and not the reverse water gas\nshift reaction (RWGS), the reverse of reaction (3). An additional advantage could be a decrease of the water content of the gas over the\ncatalyst and thereby possibly reduce water-induced sintering. Fig. 3 illustrates the equilibrium conversions after equilibrating the metha-\nnol reaction \u2013 with and without equilibrating the water gas shift reaction. An increase in the equilibrium conversion can be obtained at\nhigher temperatures and may have some applicability in adiabatic reactors, if the low temperature activity of today \u00b4s catalysts is main-\ntained, but using standard methanol synthesis temperatures seems more favorable for conversion. To evaluate industrial relevance, future\nwork should focus on CO formation at high conversions to methanol. It is also important to separate selectivity to CO from those of hydro-\ncarbons and C 2+ alcohols, because CO may be recycled while formation of higher alcohols, methane, higher hydrocarbons or wax repre-\nsents a loss of product and a separation or even a fouling problem.\nDecreasing byproduct formation could also result in optimized plant designs for example by increasing temperature in adiabatic and\ncooled reactors to increase activity and reduce reactor size and still obey the requirements of low byproducts or reduce the size of the dis-\ntillation section. Byproduct formation is presumably controlled by the reaction routes proposed for synthesis of higher alcohols over Cu\ncatalysts [16].\nFinally, it should be mentioned that other paths may be used to make methanol such as electrochemical reduction of CO 2-to-methanol\nand direct catalytic and non-catalytic oxidation of methane-to-methanol. The two latter processes are dif\ufb01cult due to high barriers for C AH\nactivation of methane and higher activity of C AH bonds in methanol [17,18] , and for the former, there are still huge technical challenges\n[19]. If we get a breakthrough for these processes, it will be highly interesting, and it will have the potential to transform industry and make\nsmall plants more feasible, but these processes are still far away from being industrially relevant. The focus that follows will therefore be on\nperspectives for the current industrial catalyst.\n4. Mechanism, carriers and promoters for methanol synthesis catalysts\nFirst, a few comments on the literature on methanol synthesis catalysts will be made. Although methanol synthesis catalysts represent a\nrelatively mature technology, it is still a dynamic research area with many new emerging directions and with several contradicting views\non fundamental catalytic aspects. It is possible to \ufb01nd support for nearly every hypothesis about the reaction mechanism, the active site\nand how promoters and carriers affect catalyst activity in the huge literature on these subjects. Thorough challenging scienti\ufb01c discussions\nare very stimulating, but previous results are sometimes not taken appropriately into account in newer reports. It is important that new\nmechanisms and concepts are suggested with great care and thoroughness, as the literature will otherwise tend to diverge rather than con-\nverge, and subsequent conclusions will be dif\ufb01cult to draw. It is perhaps a tendency that publication of new mechanisms or concepts are\neasier and more honorable than evaluating in detail whether the new \ufb01ndings indeed are substantial contributions leaving thorough test-\ning of new or older hypotheses as clean-up-work that can be overlooked. This means that the literature is growing, but solid coherent pic-\ntures do not necessarily emerge.\nCare is also important in the particularly interesting subject of new catalysts. It is important that proposed new formulations are tested\nat relevant synthesis conditions, where they can be compared directly with industrial type catalysts. Technical details should be suf\ufb01ciently\ndescribed to render reproduction and make a thorough evaluation possible. Furthermore, sometimes less active reference catalysts are\nused for comparison and it is recommended that new catalysts are compared not only on a turn-over-frequency (TOF) basis, but also\non a weight and volume basis with the current Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3catalyst that has high density and surface area of the active material. This\nwould make it easier to base new improvements on solid common knowledge in the \ufb01eld.\nNevertheless, the literature contains many excellent scienti\ufb01c reports including studies of catalyst formulations, preparations of Cu/ZnO\ncatalysts, mechanisms for methanol synthesis over Cu and Cu/ZnO catalysts, and interactions between Cu and ZnO, which will be discussed\nbrie\ufb02y below.\nFig. 3. Single pass carbon equilibrium conversions to methanol at 50 bar total pressure of a gas mixture containing 25% CO 2and 75% H 2with and without equilibrating the\nwater gas shift reaction.J. Sehested / Journal of Catalysis 371 (2019) 368\u2013375 371Research in methanol synthesis catalysts has been an active scienti\ufb01c area for decades and a boost in our knowledge was initiated by the\npioneering work of Klier [20] in the beginning of the 1980s, and new learnings have emerged throughout the years. The attention to metha-\nnol synthesis got a revival in the last 10\u201315 years with the growing awareness of CO 2emissions and renewable fuels, and the entrance of\nnew research groups into this scienti\ufb01c \ufb01eld. Still, we have not experienced a step change in this area since the 1960s, where the Cu/ZnO/\nAl2O3catalyst was invented and we must keep an eye on the objective of assisting advances in process technology and the development of\n\u2018\u2018clean\u201d and environmentally friendly solutions. Understanding of the present catalyst system, exploration of new preparation methods,\nand improved knowledge of new catalyst systems and promotors could all potentially lead to improved methanol synthesis catalysts,\nbut discovering new systems must have our special attention.\nThere are many reports on potential catalysts other than the Cu/ZnO chemical system, but so far none of these have emerged commer-\ncially. Several studies have obtained interesting results for Cu methanol synthesis catalysts using oxides of lanthanides and periods four\nand \ufb01ve elements as carriers and promotors [21\u201326] in CO 2/H2feeds. Furthermore, promotion of the Cu surface by precious metals [27]\nand recently non-Cu containing catalysts like Ni/Ga [11], MnO x/CoO x[28], InO x/ZrO 2[29] and ZnO/ZrO 2[30] catalysts were evaluated\nfor CO 2/H2to methanol. It seems that these catalysts cannot compete directly in their present form with the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3cat-\nalyst at low temperatures, where the methanol equilibrium is most favorable, due to price, selectivity and lower volume based activity at\nlower temperatures. Nevertheless, oxide catalysts expand our opportunities to make breakthrough discoveries and spur further academicinterest because they contain functionalities that are complementary to the industrial metal-based catalysts and this group of materials is\ncertainly an interesting research area to explore.\nA large number of papers have reported on the preparation of Cu/ZnO catalysts. Boosting the interaction between Cu and ZnO to opti-\nmize methanol synthesis catalysts is of great scienti\ufb01c interest and has also positive industrial prospects. Considerable progress was made\nin this area for example by the thorough work of Behrens et al. [31] and the optimization study of Baltes et al. [32], giving both a deep\nunderstanding of each step in the preparation and improved synthesis parameters. Several variations in the preparation methods were\nexplored, including addition of Ga and Mg [33], various amounts of Al [33] and new preparation methods [34]. Suitable catalysts for bench-\nmarking explorative catalysts can be found in references [32,33] .\nThe reaction mechanism for methanol synthesis over Cu was studied in a large number of papers using kinetic isotope experiments,\nab initio calculations, kinetic experiments [24,35\u201340] and advanced characterization methods [41,42] . Experiments with isotopically\nmarked CO and CO\n2show that CO 2is the preferred carbon precursor for methanol formation over Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3catalysts at low conversion\n[35,37] in agreement with more fundamental work showing that only CO 2and not CO is converted to methanol over Cu single crystals [43].\nConversion of CO/H 2is possible over Cu supported on basic carriers [35,44] and on single crystals and polycrystalline Cu, when promoted\nwith alkali metals [45,46] . Interestingly, Cu/ZrO 2catalysts seem to perform well in both CO/H 2and CO 2/H2gas mixtures [25], while Cu/ZnO\nis not operating well in pure CO/H 2mixtures [47]. It is surprising that Cu lanthanides have recently been reported to be superior for CO 2/H2\nto methanol as it appears to contradict previous work showing that CO/H 2gas mixtures are preferred for making methanol over Cu par-\nticles on basic supports [35,44] .\nRecent state of the art total energy calculations/ab initio studies and microkinetic modelling have advanced our knowledge about the\nreaction mechanism of CO and CO 2to methanol [35,48,49] .C O 2-to-methanol is described to proceed via hydrogenation of formate to\nmethanol via H 2COOH, formaldehyde, and methoxy species, while CO reacts via successive hydrogenation to formaldehyde, methoxy\nand methanol.\n5. Cu \u2013 Zn interactions\nToday, all commercial catalysts contain Cu and ZnO1, which raises the question of whether zinc is unique and the only relevant promoter\nfor Cu-based methanol catalysts? The role of ZnO in the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3methanol synthesis catalyst has attracted a lot of attention in\nthe literature and is a very interesting subject scienti\ufb01cally, not only in itself, but also due to the analogy with other metal-promoter systems.\nThere is a strong consensus and overwhelming evidence in the literature that ZnO is an excellent electronic and structural (by increasing Cu\ndispersion) promoter for methanol formation over Cu [14,15,35,40,50\u201356] . Just to highlight a few recent studies, Kurz et al. [55] achieved an\nimprovement in activity of nearly a factor of three upon addition of zinc to a Cu/Al 2O3catalyst and van den Berg et al. [51] measured an\nincrease in activity of \ufb01ve to seven times after zinc addition to Cu/SiO 2or Cu/C catalysts. Nakamura and Fujitani [39,52,57,58] estimate a\nsix and thirteen times improvement in methanol activity when adding twenty surface mole % of Zn to polycrystalline Cu and Cu(1 1 1) before\nmethanol synthesis, respectively, while Kattel et al. [40,54] claim a 25 to 90 times higher activity upon deposition of twenty mole % ZnO on Cu\n(1 1 1). So there is agreement about a signi\ufb01cant increase in activity of Cu catalysts after zinc addition. One exception is the work of Waugh and\ncoworkers [59,60] , who claim that zinc is only a structural promoter based on similar TOFs for a series of catalysts calculated from activity\nmeasurements and Cu surface areas obtained by N 2O-RFC (reactive frontal chromatography) [59]. Although nano-crystalline ZnO helps dis-\npersing Cu nanoparticles in commercial catalysts, the use of N 2O-RFC may be sidetracked by oxidation of reduced Zn or oxygen vacancies\nin ZnO [61,62] .\nWhile the consensus is strong concerning the existence of the promotional effect of zinc in Cu catalysts, the structure of the active site is\nstill discussed. The origin of the Cu\u2013ZnO synergy is an architype of metal-promoter structure and is one of the most studied examples of\ncatalyst synergy. Quite a number of different models for the origin of this Cu\u2013ZnO synergy have been proposed [6,15,20,38,40\u201342,48,49,52\u2013\n54,56\u201359,63\u201373] . Scienti\ufb01c discussions have recently focused on Cu shape changes and consequently exposure of more active Cu facets\n[65,68,71] , on Cu-ZnO interface sites, for example, at the edges of ZnO overlayers on Cu surfaces [6,40,54,63,64,67] and on partly reduced\nsingle Zn atoms in the surface of Cu [15,35,42,50,52,53,57] . While these models appear contradictory to each other, they may in principle\ncoexist as discussed further below and to some extent re\ufb02ect different structural responses of the same dynamic phenomenon [15,72] . The\ncritical issues are therefore \ufb01nding their relative contributions to the methanol synthesis reaction rate, determine whether these effects are\ninterlinked or collaborate and establish how the improved understanding can be used to develop the catalyst.\n1Zn, ZnO, and zinc are used to describe single zinc atoms in the Cu surface, zinc atoms that are part of a zinc oxide sheet or crystal and zinc atoms in an unsp eci\ufb01ed structure,\nrespectively.372 J. Sehested / Journal of Catalysis 371 (2019) 368\u2013375The view on the Cu-ZnO synergy has evolved over the years by employing sophisticated characterization tools and theoretical methods\nsuch as Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared studies (IR), adsorption mea-\nsurements, and density functional theory (DFT). These approaches have given insight into the highly dynamic behavior of Cu nanoparticles\nsupported at larger ZnO particles under operating conditions and demonstrated that the shape of the Cu nanoparticles adjust to the reac-\ntion conditions [65,68,71,73] . These shape changes were attributed to changes in the interface energies of Cu on ZnO and more recently to\nZn atoms in the Cu surface [15]; i.e., Zn atoms in the surface of Cu particles have an impact on Cu particle shape because the particle surface\nenergies are reduced by Zn atoms and will thus tend to decrease the contact angles for Cu particles on \ufb02at supports. Similarly, oxygen\nvacancies in ZnO at the Cu-ZnO interface could increase the interface energies and hence decrease the contact angle.\nTransient variations in activity with changes in gas reduction potential were ascribed to dissimilar rates of methanol synthesis over dif-\nferent Cu facets. Nonetheless, single crystal measurements suggest only a difference of approximately 2\u20132.5 in area speci\ufb01c activity\nbetween Cu(1 1 1) and Cu(1 1 0), when the surface densities of the facets are taken into account [57,74,75] , while microkinetic modelling\nindicates a stronger effect [68]. Interestingly, recent DFT calculations propose that the methanol activity over Cu is extremely structure-\nsensitive and dominated by a few step atoms with and without Zn atom substitution of Cu surface atoms [35,42] . In this picture, the sim-\nilarity of the activities of different Cu facets could be due to a few strong binding defect sites dominating the overall methanol activity. A\nlinear dependency between activity and formate coverage (after evacuation at 100 /C176C) for a series of different Cu single crystal facets and Zn\npromoted Cu facets [39], may possibly be understood in the light of this theory-based hypothesis.\nThe concept of shape changes is well documented and interesting as it demonstrates that the shape of the Cu particles will adjust to the\ncomposition of the gas mixture and interactions with the surrounding ceramic spacers/promotors such as ZnO and Al 2O3, seemingly leav-\ning little room to maintain an initially prepared large fraction of a highly active Cu facet that is thermodynamically unstable at the syn-\nthesis conditions. While the dynamic shapes gave an account for many phenomena, there were also observations that they could not\naccount for. IR and EELS measurements suggested that Zn could be incorporated into the Cu surfaces and this gives a hint that the Zn alloy-\ning itself could be the cause of the shape changes and also the root cause for the promoted activity [15,50,72,76] . At Topsoe, we therefore\nstudied this mechanism in detail in industrial type catalysts.\nRecently, we proposed a quantitative model that describes the Zn promoting effect by incorporation of reduced Zn into the Cu surface\n[15]. Brie\ufb02y, ZnO particles and Zn alloying in Cu particles are in thermodynamic equilibrium with CO and CO 2in the gas phase and can be\ndescribed analytically using well established thermodynamic data from the literature. DFT was applied to calculate segregation energies of\nZn in Cu as a simple \u2018\u2018broken-bond-model\u201d [56] was not suf\ufb01ciently precise to give a satisfying description. We estimated the overall cov-\nerages of Zn at the surface of Cu particles as a function of the CO/CO 2ratio from the coverages of Zn on Cu at a series of Cu facets assuming a\ncubo-octahedral shape of the Cu particles. This model compared well with experimental Zn coverages determined from the loss of Cu areas\nas determined by H 2-TPD (temperature programmed desorption). Finally, we veri\ufb01ed the effect on activity of these Zn-Cu sites in the Cu\nsurface.\nThis model explains some of the key observations reported in the literature such as dynamic shape effects, transient changes in activity\nand activity variations with CO/CO 2ratios [15]. It is also in excellent agreement with the catalyst and single crystal work of Fujitani and\nNakamura [57], who conclude that CO 2hydrogenation to methanol is promoted by reduced Zn atoms and disclose that formate, preferably\nattached to Zn in the Cu surface, is the precursor for methanol formation. Interestingly, the model predicts that methanol activity of Cu/ZnO\ncatalysts does not only depend on the active Cu surface area, but also on ZnO promoter particle sizes due to the increase in thermodynamic\nactivity of Zn and thereby the coverage of Zn at Cu with decreasing ZnO particle size. A perhaps more surprising effect is that Zn coverages\ndecrease for smaller Cu particle sizes lending smaller Cu particles to be less ef\ufb01ciently promoted by Zn than larger Cu particles, i.e., lower\nTOF for smaller Cu particles. Such an effect was recently reported by van den Berg et al. [51], but this comparison should be done with the\nreservation that changes in the fractions of active sites, possibly B 5or B 6sites [42], with particle size, are not included in the model. The\nmodel provides at present the most detailed description of the Cu-ZnO synergy in methanol synthesis catalysts as it includes the depen-\ndencies on Cu and ZnO particle sizes as well as reaction conditions. The model therefore offers a basis for further improvements of indus-\ntrial catalysts and for making predictions that may be tested further.\nThis picture was recently questioned by Rodriguez and coworkers [40,64] , who argued that ZnO layers over Cu and/or Cu-ZnO interface\nsites constitute the active site for methanol synthesis. These authors performed experimental studies of methanol synthesis from CO 2and\nH2at a pressure of 5 atm. over ZnO deposited on Cu(1 1 1), Cu and ZnO deposited on ZnO(000 1/C0\n) and theoretical investigations of Zn 6O7H7\nislands over Cu(1 1 1). As outlined above critical focus on discrepancies can be of extraordinary importance to advance our understanding\nof structure-function relations in catalysis. However, in a following discussion of this work [53,54] , it turned out that one of the main exper-\nimental observations, i.e. the presence of ZnO after activity tests, were included in previous XPS measurements by Fujitani and Nakamura\n[58], who, through additional thorough experiments reported in a series of papers [39,52,57] , showed that more elaborate measurements\nwould have been needed for Rodriguez et al. to unambiguously determine the chemical state of zinc. This discussion re\ufb02ects that the\nmature literature on the fundamental science in methanol synthesis by Cu/ZnO catalysts should be consulted in depth in attempts to make\nnovel breakthroughs.\nNevertheless, depicting the active site in Cu/ZnO catalysts at the interface between Cu and ZnO particles and/or at the edge of ZnO over-\nlayers over Cu still needs to be carefully considered due to the amount of evidence for these type of active structures [6,40,54,63,64,67] and\nthe similarity with other methanol-active Cu-oxide systems [24,25,26] . In my view, reduced Zn atoms in a Cu surface are active for metha-\nnol synthesis [15,35,39,42,50,52,53,57] , and the concentration of Zn in the active Cu particles is governed by catalyst morphology, catalyst\ncomposition, Cu and ZnO particle sizes, synthesis conditions and thermodynamics [15]. This is apparently a property that to some extent\nmakes zinc unique compared with other promoters/carriers that have a promoting effect on Cu and this may be the reason why ZnO is still\nused commercially after 50 years of service. Nonetheless, Kuld et al. [50] report that N 2O-RFC and H 2-TPD provide similar Cu surface areas\nfor an industrial type methanol synthesis catalyst reduced at 10 mbar H 2at 220 /C176C. However, adopting the newly reported H 2:Cu stoi-\nchiometry [61,62] , results in 25% lower Cu surface areas determined by H 2-TPD than those reported in [50] and this indicates the existence\nof additional reduced sites that are accessible for N 2O, but not titrated by H 2. Interestingly, Cu+1is found in detailed surface characterization\nstudies after a mild reduction of Cu/ZnO/SiO 2catalysts [41]. One could speculate that oxygen vacancy sites at the Cu-ZnO interface or at the\nrim of the Cu particles could give the additional oxygen uptake from N 2O[50,61,62] and may be active for methanol synthesis, especially inJ. Sehested / Journal of Catalysis 371 (2019) 368\u2013375 373less reducing gas mixtures, i.e., at low CO/CO 2ratios, where the steady state coverage of reduced Zn in the Cu surface is relatively low [15].\nThese considerations suggest that while Zn-Cu is documented as the active site for methanol synthesis under typical industrial reaction\nconditions, a corporative Cu-ZnO site may also contribute under more oxidizing conditions and this dual site model could be relevant\nto elucidate in further detail.\n6. Conclusions\nMethanol is a large-scale bulk chemical that is currently manufactured from common fossil hydrocarbon feedstocks. Methanol synthesis\nis one of the possible solutions to the energy challenges that we face in the 21st century as it may be produced from renewable resources\nand has an energy density that allows demanding long-distance transport without refueling. Methanol is also an excellent precursor for\nmaking many bulk chemicals including ole\ufb01ns, formaldehyde, acetic acid, methyl chloride, DME, dimethyl terephthalate, etc.\nOne of the main challenges in lowering the environmental footprint of the methanol industry, using small rural gas supplies, biomass\ngasi\ufb01cation or CO 2waste streams combined with H 2from electrolysis, is the demand for more economic solutions for smaller production\nplants. It will be dif\ufb01cult for smaller plants to compete with new world class-methanol-plants fueled by cheap natural gas on an equal basis\nso subsidies and regulations will be needed in a transition period. However, in a low CO 2emission society, where \ufb02aring is unacceptable,\nsmall-scale methanol production could be attractive. The main route to methanol in a foreseeable future is still thermal via synthesis gas as\nmethanol production via direct electrolysis, photo-catalysis, non-catalytic synthesis and direct methane-to-methanol synthesis, all need\nmajor technological breakthroughs to be commercially interesting.\nToday \u00b4s technology provides an applicable solution for combining CO 2and H 2to make methanol, although the industrial methanol syn-\nthesis catalyst is slightly less ef\ufb01cient and shows somewhat faster thermal sintering in CO 2rich feed gasses. Making the industrial metha-\nnol catalyst even more stable could be interesting, but a really attractive improvement could be to enhance the low temperature activity of\nthe methanol synthesis catalyst since lower temperatures would allow better equilibrium conditions, lower synthesis pressures, and\nthereby decrease the demand for expensive compression especially in smaller productions. Ef\ufb01cient handling of impurities is also an issue\nespecially in the light of some unconventional impurities present in alternative feed gasses and in this connection a sulfur tolerant synthe-\nsis could be highly interesting. Both increasing the knowledge and \ufb01nding simpli\ufb01ed solutions to these challenges is of industrial\nimportance.\nDevelopment and understanding of methanol synthesis catalysts are still very active research areas. We could hope that we in the\nfuture, based on experimental evidence, obtain a theoretical description with predictive power to strengthen our search for catalysts with\nhigher low temperature activity or resistance towards impurities.\nAcknowledgement\nI would like to thank Stig Helveg, Martin Skov Skj\u00f8th-Rasmussen and Henrik Guldberg Pedersen for careful reading of manuscript and\nmany valuable comments and suggestions.\nReferences\n[1]https://igpenergy.com/methanol-overview/ ,https://www.methanol.org/the-methanol-industry/ .\n[2]G.A.

However, big challenges remain in developing remote sensing-based models for mapping \nconcentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide (cCO2) in lakes at regional or global scales. We developed a cCO2 \nestimation model using Sentinel-3-derived lake environmental variables and near-synchronous field cCO2 data \nfrom 16 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai River (ML_YHR) basins in Eastern China \n(N =248). Stepwise quadratic polynomial regressions of several combinations of chlorophyll- a (Chl-a), water \ntemperature (Tw), Secchi disk depth (ZSD), and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR)-related variables were \ntested and validated to select the best approach. The final model showed high performance in calibration and \nvalidation (R2 >0.72, RMSE <6.35 \u03bcmol L\u00001, MAPE <30.31%). The model sensitivity analysis, based on Monte \nCarlo simulations, showed the model \u2019s estimated bias as <25% based on uncertainties of all input variables. \nSpatial and temporal dynamics of dissolved CO2 concentrations in 113 lakes (\u226510 km2) in the ML_YHR basins \nwere mapped from 2016 to 2021 using the Sentinel-3 data. The result showed that CO2 concentrations were low \nin the summer and autumn but high in the winter and spring with dramatic variations (e.g., mean coefficient of \nvariation: 52.59%). The annual mean CO2 concentrations of lakes revealed that about 28% of the lakes acted as \nweak atmospheric CO2 sinks (14.96 \u00b11.13 \u03bcmol L\u00001) while the rest were sources (19.22 \u00b12.02 \u03bcmol L\u00001), \ncompared with a mean concentration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium (16.29 \u03bcmol L\u00001). CO2 concentrations \ndecreased with increasing eutrophication and decreasing lake size (p <0.05). This study advances current \nknowledge about CO2 emissions from emerging meso-eutrophic lakes and shows how satellite remote sensing can \nexpand the spatiotemporal coverage of lake CO2.   \n1.Introduction \nLakes play an essential role in the carbon cycle as they emit green -\nhouse gas equivalent to nearly 20% of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions \n(DelSontro et al., 2018 ) despite their small surface area, which is only \nabout 3.7% of the global non-glacial land area (Verpoorter et al., 2014 ). \nHowever, current bottom-up estimates of CO2 emissions from lakes have \nsignificant uncertainties due to the lack of in situ data. One of the crucial \nreasons for these uncertainties is the large bias of lake type in the global \nlake datasets used in the global emission estimation. Global warming \nand nutrient enrichment due to agriculture and urbanization has increased eutrophication of lakes since the 20th century (Ho et al., \n2019 ). About 63.1% of global lakes larger than 25 km2 are already \neutrophic, covering about 30.5% of the water surface area (Wang et al., \n2018 ). Eutrophication can largely affect the aquatic carbon cycle by \npromoting atmospheric carbon sequestration as sediment and dissolved \norganic carbon (Pacheco et al., 2014 ). However, only <1% of the 7939 \nlakes and reservoirs in the dataset of Raymond et al. (2013) represent \neutrophic lakes, and most of them are boreal lakes north of the 40\u25e6N \nlatitude, resulting in a lack of representativeness of lake types and \nregional distribution, which hinders accurate estimation of global lake \nCO2 emissions. \n*Corresponding author at: 73 East Beijing Road, Nanjing 210008, China. \nE-mail address: htduan@niglas.ac.cn (H.

The increased inputs of terrestrial carbon \nentering the lake with nutrients increase the lake\u2019s CO2 (Weyhenmeyer \net al., 2015 ). On the other hand, the algae emerging with increasing \nnutrients promote primary productivity and reduce the lake CO2 \n(Pacheco et al., 2014 ). The unclear counterbalance of these two pro-\ncesses results in complex carbon cycle roles that create many problems \nfor eutrophic lakes (DelSontro et al., 2018 ; Loken et al., 2019 ; Borges \net al., 2022 ). Specifically, even in tropical lakes reported to be strong \nemitters of CO2 into the atmosphere (Marotta et al., 2009 ), eutrophi -\ncation induces high Chl-a, which leads to undersaturated dissolved CO2 \nthat acts as CO2 sinks (Borges et al., 2022 ). As an eutrophic lake in \ntemperate regions, Lake Mendota shows dramatic seasonal CO2 varia -\ntions (6.8\u2013184.3 \u03bcmol L\u00001) and significant spatial heterogeneity in the \nautumn mixing period (Loken et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, eutrophication \ncan offset or even reverse carbon emissions from an oligotrophic lake \n(Pacheco et al., 2014 ). The size-productivity weighted upscaling esti-\nmates of global lakes by DelSontro et al. (2018) were about 50% lower \nthan the estimation based on size weighted upscaling alone, which also \nproved the importance of eutrophic lakes in global lake CO2 emission \nestimates. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of labor and material \nresources, it is impossible for field sampling to cover all the lakes within \nthe higher frequency than quarterly or annually (Raymond et al., 2013 ; \nHolgerson and Raymond, 2016 ). New large-scale approaches need to be \ndeveloped to fulfill the need to monitor the high spatiotemporal varia -\ntions in lakes \u2019 CO2. \nSatellite remote sensing has accumulated massive continuous \nobservation data owing to its broad coverage and high spatiotemporal \nresolution. Based on massive satellite-to-field matchups and high- \nprecision satellite products, remote sensing methods have become \nessential for synoptic estimation of oceanic surface dissolved CO2 (Bai \net al., 2015 ; Chen et al., 2016 ; Chen et al., 2019a ). In principle, the \noceanic surface dissolved CO2 concentration is mainly controlled by \nthermodynamic processes, biological activities, and physical mixing \n(Takahashi et al., 2002 ; Biswas et al., 2004 ; Takahashi et al., 2009 ). \nThese processes can be simulated by satellite-derivable variables such as \nsea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), Chl-a, and the \ndownwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd) (Bai et al., 2015 ; Chen \net al., 2016 ; Lohrenz et al., 2018 ). As the sea gets closer to the land, the \ninteraction between oceanic CO2-controlling processes and their related \nfactors gets stronger, complicating the CO2 estimation model. In open \noceans, dissolved CO2 is mainly controlled by the thermodynamic pro-\ncess, and can be estimated by sea surface temperatures using simple \nlinear regression (Boutin et al., 1999 ). In relatively closed bays or coastal \nareas (e.g., the Gulf of Mexico, the Baltic Sea, and the East China Sea) \nwhere biological and river-sea interactions are enhanced, nonlinear al-\ngorithms (e.g., polynomial regression, semi-analytics, machine learning \nalgorithms) are required. Variables related to biological processes (Chl- \na, Kd), physical mixing (SSS) and thermodynamic processes (SST) are \nalso necessary inputs used to jointly describe the dynamics of dissolved \nCO2 (Bai et al., 2015 ; Chen et al., 2016 ; Parard et al., 2016 ; Lohrenz \net al., 2018 ). However, models developed for specific sea areas have \nlimitations in regional extrapolation performance. Massive multi- \nregional representative field data and more complicated algorithms (e. \ng., semi-analytical and machine learning algorithms) are needed to \ndevelop models with general applicability for more sea areas (Chen \net al., 2017 ; Chen et al., 2019a ). \nUnlike the way it\u2019s handled in the ocean, dissolved CO2 in lakes is \ncontrolled by endogenous biological effects, thermodynamics, physical \nmixing, and exogenous terrestrial organic and inorganic carbon input \nfrom rivers (Tranvik et al., 2009 ). In particular, due to the relatively \nsmall volume of lakes, the exchange of material and energy between \nlakes and terrestrial ecosystems via rivers and lake shorelines is intense, \nprofoundly affecting various endogenous biochemical processes in lakes \n(Cole et al., 2007 ; Tranvik et al., 2009 ). In addition to predicting lake \nthermal processes, the water temperature can also indicate photosynthesis intensity together with Chl-a and Kd (Qi et al., 2020 ). \nDissolved organic carbon (DOC) and coloured dissolved organic matter \n(CDOM) are potential predictors of dissolved CO2, because they are in-\ndicators of organic matter mineralization processes or exogenous inputs \nthat lead to a CO2 increase (Sobek et al., 2005 ; Raymond et al., 2013 ; \nKlaus et al., 2019 ). However, most lakes lack accurate satellite products \nof the variables discussed in this section. Few studies are currently \navailable on the use of satellite products to estimate lake CO2, which has \nseverely limited the expansion of long-term remote sensing data \n(Campbell et al., 2022 ). There are only exploratory studies on Lake \nM\u00a8alaren (Kutser et al., 2015 ), Lake Erie (Ouyang et al., 2017 ), and Lake \nTaihu (Qi et al., 2020 ). Among them, a relatively mature study by Qi \net al. (2020) represents the best model (Taihu model) developed for the \nmost well-known eutrophic shallow lake in China - Lake Taihu. This \nstudy reconstructs nearly 20 years of dissolved CO2 in Lake Taihu, \nthereby proving the potential of satellite remote sensing for long-term \nmonitoring of lake CO2 dynamics. However, due to the heterogeneity \nof biogeochemical processes among different types of lakes, it is unclear \nwhether the Taihu model can be applied to other lakes worldwide. \nConsiderable differences have been found in the optical properties \nbetween lakes as well as between seasons for the same lake, leading to \ngreat challenges in developing a uniform algorithm for regional or \nglobal lakes (Shen et al., 2020 ; Pahlevan et al., 2022 ). For instance, lakes \nin the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai River \n(ML_YHR) basins include several types of lakes, from mesotrophic to \nhighly eutrophic (Hu et al., 2022 ). The highly eutrophic lakes with \nfrequent cyanobacterial blooms in the ML_YHR basins include Lake \nTaihu in the Yangtze Delta and Lake Chaohu in Hefei (the capital of the \nAnhui Province) (Duan et al., 2015 ; Duan et al., 2017 ). Besides, there are \nalso lakes with a lower eutrophication and a high river \u2013lake connectivity \nwith large amounts of suspended matter, such as Lake Hongze, Poyang, \nand Dongting (Hou et al., 2017 ; Shen et al., 2020 ). MODIS data has \nabout two decades of earth observations; however, many algorithms \nbased on MODIS data were developed for monitoring the long-term \ndynamics of a single lake (e.g., Lake Taihu) (Shi et al., 2015a ; Shi \net al., 2015b ; Huang et al., 2017 ). Mature MODIS-based water quality \nparameters algorithms for inland waters have not been fully developed \nto date (e.g., Chl-a), because MODIS was developed for open ocean \nwaters and does not have spectral bands in the red and NIR part of the \nspectrum which is critical for estimating Chl-a in eutrophic waters \n(Gitelson, 1992 ; Cao et al., 2022b ). The Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land \nColour Instrument (OLCI) performance in retrieving water quality pa-\nrameters in lakes has been well demonstrated by different authors (Xue \net al., 2019 ; Shen et al., 2020 ; Soomets et al., 2020a ; Soomets et al., \n2020b ; Pahlevan et al., 2022 ), since it was developed specifically for \ncoastal and inland waters. MODIS is also close to the end of its life, while \nfunding for the next Sentinel-3 (C, D and onward) is secured for decades \nto come. Therefore, we chose to use the OLCI sensor for evaluating the \nlake CO2 even though it has shorter time series at present. Existing \nstudies have achieved a high-precision inversion of the primary optical \nparameters (e.g., Chl-a and ZSD) for lakes in the ML_YHR basins based on \nthe Sentinel-3 OLCI data (Xu et al., 2019 ; Shen et al., 2020 ). Standard \nsurface temperatures and photosynthetic active radiation products \nderived from Sentinel-3 data have been released, which meet the basic \nrequirements of the Taihu CO2 model proposed by Qi et al. (2020) . \nMoreover, the reconstruction of dissolved cCO2 in eutrophic lakes will \nhelp fill the gap in the current global lake dataset, which is of great \nsignificance for reducing uncertainty concerning the global lake CO2 \nemission estimation. \nThis study was conducted to achieve three objectives: (1) to \nconstruct a high-precision dissolved CO2 concentration estimation \nmodel suitable for lakes in the ML_YHR basins based on Sentinel-3 data; \n(2) to evaluate the performance and uncertainty of the model by veri-\nfying the results with our independent data and comparing with the \nexisting research in the ML_YHR basins; (3) to reconstruct a multi-year \nseries of dissolved CO2 concentrations for lakes in the ML_YHR basins T. Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n3based on all available multi-year Sentinel-3 satellite data from May 2016 \nto December 2021. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to \nestimate dissolved CO2 in lakes from space at a regional scale. \n2.Data and methods \n2.1. Study areas \nThe middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai River \n(ML_YHR) basins are located in the eastern plain of China (27.78\u25e6- \n36.10\u25e6N, 111.70\u25e6-121.67\u25e6E, Fig. 1). The ML_YHR basins are in a sub-\ntropical monsoon climate region with favorable hydrothermal condi -\ntions and abundant water sources to replenish the lakes within it. The \nML_YHR basins includes 605 natural lakes (excluding reservoirs) larger \nthan 1 km2, with a total lake area of 20,762 km2 (Ma et al., 2011 ). Due to \nthe fast-growing social and economic development of eastern China in \nthe last half century, a large amount of nitrogen-rich sewage was dis-\ncharged into lakes (Yu et al., 2019 ). This excess nitrogen led to the \ndeterioration of aquatic ecosystems and fast eutrophication of ML_YHR \nlakes (Hu et al., 2022 ). The frequent occurrence of cyanobacterial \nblooms endangers the ecological health of lakes and the lives of sur-\nrounding residents (Duan et al., 2015 ; Duan et al., 2017 ). At the same \ntime, eutrophication dramatically changed the CO2 emission dynamics \nin lakes, making lakes in this region a hotspot for lake-related carbon \ncycle research (Lee et al., 2014 ; Ran et al., 2021 ; Xiao et al., 2022 ). In \nthis study, considering the limitations of the spatial resolution \n(approximately 300 m) of the Sentinel-3 OLCI data, 113 lakes (>10 km2) \nlocated in the ML_YHR basins were examined (Fig. 1). 2.2. Field data \nBased on lake sizes, hydrological conditions, and the trophic status of \nthe lakes reported in published studies (Zou et al., 2020 ; Hu et al., 2022 ), \n16 lakes were selected in the ML_YHR basins (as shown in Fig. 1 with \nbasic properties shown in Table 1). Six field surveys were conducted in \nJuly 2018, October 2019, September and October 2020, and April, June, \nand December 2021. For samplings of each lake, 5 to 30 sample points \nwere set in the lake\u2019s pelagic area and carried out simultaneously with \nSentinel-3 overpasses. At each sampling site, surface water samples \n(0\u201350 cm) were collected to analyses water quality and optical param -\neters (including Chl-a, DOC, CDOM absorbance, and suspended partic -\nulate matter (SPM)). A standard 5 L acrylic water-fetching instrument \nwas used to collect the water. The samples were stored in cold dark \nconditions before laboratory analysis. The specific measurement \nmethods have been detailed in previous studies (Xue et al., 2017 ; Xiao \net al., 2020 ). For dissolved cCO2 measurements, a headspace equilib -\nrium method based on the workflow of Goldenfum (2010) and Striegl \net al. (2012) was used. In short, about 16 mL of bubble-free surface \nwater samples were injected through a 20 mL polypropylene syringe \ninto 30-mL glass serum bottles. The syringe was fitted with a three-way \nstopcock and a 1.2-\u03bcm syringe filter. The serum bottles had been pre-\nviously flushed with N2 at atmospheric pressure and sealed with stop-\npers at the laboratory. Serum bottles also contained 2 g of potassium \nchloride (KCl) to inhibit microbial activity. CO2 gas volume fractions in \nthe headspace gas were measured using a gas chromatograph (Agilent- \n7890B) in the laboratory. cCO2 at field conditions were calculated using \nmeasured headspace gas volume fractions, averaged total barometric \npressure at the sample collection site, field water temperatures, \nFig. 1.Map of lakes larger than 10 km2 in the study area.

A total \nof 669 sample points were obtained (Table 1). The main parameters of \neach lake varied in a wide range, and their distribution was close to the \npositively skewed distribution, which was representative of the study \narea (Fig. S1). \n2.3. Satellite data \nBenefitting from the band setting and spatial resolution, the Sentinel- \n3 OLCI is considered one of the most suitable satellite sensors for water \ncolour remote sensing in inland waters (IOCCG, 2018 ). Previous study \nhas proved the cross-mission consistency of data obtained by OLCI \nsensors equipped on Sentinel-3 A and B (Zibordi et al., 2022 ). Therefore, \nwe used the OLCI data that both Sentinel-3 A and B obtained to retrieve \nthe lakes \u2019 optical parameters. Our goal was to obtain the maximum \nnumber of valid images. The Sentinel-3 A/B OLCI level-1B FR and the \nSea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) level-2 land \nsurface temperature (LST) images were downloaded from the European \nSpace Agency (ESA) Copernicus Open Access Hub. These images cover \nthe ML_YHR basins between May 2016 and December 2021. Image \nquality control and selection were done with the following preprocess -\ning. The Sentinel-3 OLCI level-2 instantaneous PAR (iPAR) product was \ndownloaded from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) with online data access at \nhttps://data.eumetsat.int/ . The MODIS 3 km aerosol product \n(MOD04_3K) was required as an input to the atmospheric correction and \nwas downloaded from NASA \u2019s Earth Observing System Data and Infor-\nmation System (EOSDIS, https://earthdata.nasa.gov ). \nDownloaded satellite data were preprocessed following the steps \nshown in Fig. 2. First, the satellite data were roughly subset using the \nlake boundary published by Ma et al. (2011) . Then, the Rayleigh- \ncorrected reflectance (Rrc) and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) were \nderived using the satellite signal in the solar spectrum correction scheme \n(6SV) (Vermote et al., 1997 ). Shen et al. (2020) proved the performance \nof the 6SV processor in large lakes of eastern China, based on compar -\nisons with current popular atmospheric correction processors. The spe-\ncific options of 6SV processor followed Shen et al. (2020) and are shown \nin the supplementary material (Text S1). The Chl-a and ZSD algorithms in \nML_YHR lakes were developed based on random forest regression using \nOLCI Rrs data by Shen et al. (2020, 2022) . The Chl-a algorithm achieved \nhigh accuracy for eutrophic and turbid inland lakes across eastern China \n(R2 =0.73, RMSE =12.99 \u03bcg L\u00001, MAPE =36.91%) (Shen et al., 2022 ). \nThe Chl-a algorithm was also validated by our measured data and \nshowed high accuracy in ML_YHR lakes (R2 =0.82, RMSE =8.54 \u03bcg L\u00001, \nMAPE =29.61%, Fig. S2 a). The ZSD algorithm had high accuracy for \neutrophic and turbid inland lakes across eastern China (R2 =0.70, \nRMSE =0.13 m, MAPE =33.43%) (Shen et al., 2020 ). The ZSD algorithm \nalso showed high accuracy in ML_YHR lakes (R2 =0.84, RMSE =0.07 m, \nMAPE =14.07%, Fig. S2 b). \nLevel-2 satellite products were first subset and resampled to obtain \ndatasets consistent with Rrs data. The Sentinel-3 OLCI level-2 iPAR \nproduct showed good accuracy in ML_YHR lakes (R2 =0.90, RMSE =Table 1 \nName, area, depth, number of stations, and main parameters of the 16 sampled lakes in this study.

Because the diurnal \nvariation of iPAR follows a quadratic function (R2 =0.65, p <0.01, \nFig. S3 a), we used a quadratic function to fit the diurnal iPAR variation \nusing the satellite observation time, Sentinel-3 iPAR products, sunrise, \nand sunset time. The sunrise and sunset time were calculated through \nthe date, longitude and latitude of each lake. Then, a series of variables \nrelated to time and radiation were derived. They are: (1) the observation \ntime of the satellite passing over the selected sites or sampling converted \nto the ratio of 24 h (Ts, dimensionless); (2) duration between sunrise and \nobservation time (Drs in hours); (3) accumulated PAR total obtained by \nintegrating with the daily curve of iPAR from sunrise to observation time \n(aPAR, in Einstein m\u00002); (4) daily accumulated PAR obtained by inte-\ngrating with the daily curve of iPAR from sunrise to sunset (AccuPAR, in \nEinstein m\u00002 d\u00001); (5) the ratio of aPAR to AccuPAR (ks, dimensionless). \nAccuPAR calculated based on Sentinel-3 iPAR products are highly \nconsistent with in situ data (R2 =0.96, RMSE =3.68 Einstein m\u00002 s\u00001, \nMAPE =9.04%, Fig. S3 c), which proves the rationality of the fitting curve of daily iPAR and the five constructed variables just mentioned in \nthis paragraph. The iPAR and the five constructed variables were used as \nmodel inputs to participate in model calibration. The spatial resolution \nof the LST product is 1 km, which is different from the OLCI data. \nHowever, it has been verified that the product could reflect spatiotem -\nporal water temperature variations (R2 =0.96, RMSE =1.28 \u25e6C, MAPE \n=5.2%, Fig. S3 d). At the same time, there was no significant difference \nbetween pixels within the lake (mean coefficient of variation <15%). \nThus, the land surface temperature (LST) products were only resampled \nto the exact spatial resolution of the OLCI data and used as a water \ntemperature (Tw) parameter input for model calibration. \nFinally, suboptimal observation conditions such as sunglint, clouds, \nland, and algal scum pixels were masked for all products used in this \nstudy. The automated water delineation algorithm proposed by Wang \net al. (2014) was used to identify the water pixels and mask land pixels \naccurately. Three water pixels near the land boundary were excluded to \nremove the pixels near the land possibly contaminated by the land \nFig. 2.Schematic block diagram illustrating the primary process of satellite data processing and model development.

Cloud pixels were identified and masked \nbased on the criteria of Rrc(865) >0.25 and Rrc(560) >0.25 (Qi et al., \n2014 ). Algal scum pixels were detected using the floating algae index \n(FAI) proposed by Hu (2009) , which was calculated based on the Rrc at \n665, 865, and 1020 nm bands. Following the method of Hu et al. (2010) , \na time-independent threshold FAI =1.194 \u00d710\u00004 was adopted to mask \nalgal scum pixels. Aquatic vegetation can also be masked with this \nthreshold. After data quality control and preprocessing, each lake had an \naverage of 7 \u00b12 available images covered with few clouds per month \n(Fig. 3). The number of available images is relatively small due to the \nrainy weather in summer. \n2.4. Model development and selection \nField data samples and satellite data were matched based on \ngeographic coordinates within a time difference of \u00b13 h. A total of 248 \npairs of matchups were obtained. The distribution of the main param -\neters in the matchups is consistent with the distribution of the total field \ndataset (Fig. S1 g-i), indicating that the matchup dataset is representa -\ntive. Accordingly, 60% (N =150) of matchups were divided based on the \nconcentration gradient and used as the model calibration set (CAL). The \nremaining 98 matchups were used as the model validation set (VAL). \nSatellite-derived independent variables were used in model develop -\nment in order to cancel uncertainties in satellite products as much as \npossible through regression coefficients. Before model development, \nindependent variables with skewed distributions (skewness >2.0 and \nmin/max ratio <0.1) were log-transformed to comply with the model \u2019s \nnormality assumption. In our dataset, Chl-a and ZSD needed to be log- \ntransformed. In addition, independent variables were standardized to \nsuppress the correlation between each other. \nIn a previous study, a combination of Chl-a, Tw, Kd, and AccuPAR \ncould accurately estimate cCO2 in an eutrophic lake (Qi et al., 2020 ). In \nour dataset, cCO2 was also significantly correlated with ln(Chl- a), Tw, ln \n(ZSD), and AccuPAR (p <0.05), and Kd were highly correlated with ZSD \n(Zhang et al., 2020 ). Thus, a stepwise quadratic polynomial regression \nmodel was trained using ln(Chl- a), Tw, ln(ZSD), and AccuPAR as inde-\npendent variables (referred to in this research as Model1). \nConsidering that AccuPAR may ignore the differences in received \nradiation between samples observed at different times in one field sur-\nvey, time-related variables were added to improve model performance. \nThe Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to compare the good-\nness of fit between candidate models. The degree of interpretation of \ncCO2 variations by each model was compared by the coefficient of \ndetermination (R2). First, AccuPAR was replaced by instantaneous PAR \nvariables (iPAR and aPAR). But the model performance did not improve (Table S1). Then we tested other combinations of these PAR-related \nvariables. Only the combination of AccuPAR and iPAR improved AIC \nand R2 (Table S1). The corresponding quadratic polynomial model ob-\ntained after stepwise regression was referred to as Model2. Based on \nModel2, other time-related variables (Ts, Drs, ks) were added to \nstrengthen the estimation ability of samples observed at different times \nfor a variety of targeted lakes. Since the AIC and R2 of models were all \nimproved after adding these variables (Table S1), these three models \nremained as candidate models, referred to as Model3, Model 4, and \nModel5. Model3 (Drs) emphasizes the time to receive solar radiation. \nModel4 (Ts) emphasizes the absolute moment of observation. Model5 \n(ks) focuses on characterizing the amount of radiation accumulated at \nthe moment of observation. Furthermore, the candidate models were \nevaluated by the estimation accuracy of the calibration and validation \nsets. The final cCO2 estimation model was decided based on compre -\nhensive comparisons of the model \u2019s goodness of fit, degree of interpre -\ntation, and model performance. All models were constructed using the R \nv.4.0.5 (R is a language, and it is used in an environment for statistical \ncomputing, provided by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, \nVienna, Austria; URL https://www.R-project.org/ ). \n2.5. Model sensitivity analysis \nMonte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the model \u2019s sensitivity \nto input variables \u2019 uncertainties. Uncertainties in each satellite-derived \ninput variable were quantified based on the mean absolute relative error \n(MAPE ). The max MAPE of Chl-a was 36.91% in (Shen et al., 2022 ). The \nmax MAPE of ZSD was 33.43% in (Shen et al., 2020 ). The MAPE of the Tw \nproduct was 5.20% (Fig. S3 d). The max MAPE of the PAR product was \n9.04% (Fig. S3 b, c). Considering these MAPE from published literature \nor the evaluation results of our dataset, conservative larger uncertainties \nof 40%, 10%, 40%, and 20% were defined for the satellite derived Chl-a, \nTw, ZSD, and iPAR data, respectively. For each combination of input \nuncertainties, the Monte Carlo simulation ran 100,000 iterations for \nevery 248 field-satellite matchups. For simulated variables <0 after the \nerror was assigned, the simulations were reassigned to ensure the \ncalculation of the model (Chl-a, 1; Tw, 1; ZSD, 0.01; iPAR, 100). Since \nAccuPAR was obtained by integrating the daily iPAR, we did not \nsimulate its uncertainty separately but directly transferred the iPAR \nerrors to it. The averaged results ranged from 5th to 95th based on \n100,000 simulation results used as the final simulation result to reduce \nthe effect of extreme outliers on the simulation results. Statistics on the \ndifferences between the simulation results and original model outputs of \nall matchups were used to quantitatively evaluate the model \u2019s sensi-\ntivity to the uncertainties of different input variables. \n2.6. Statistical analysis and accuracy assessment \nStandard statistical metrics were used to quantify the accuracy of the \nestimated dissolved CO2 concentrations of different models and the \ndifferences between the simulation results and original model outputs. \nThe coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE ), \nmean absolute relative error (MAPE ), mean bias (MB), mean ratio (MR), \nand mean relative difference (MRD) were included.

Selection of cCO 2 estimation model \nOf all the five candidate models, Model3 with the input combination \nof Chl-a, ZSD, Tw, iPAR, AccuPAR, and Drs showed the best overall \nperformance (Table 2). Compared with Model1, in which variables \nrelated to observation time were omitted, other models had improved \ngoodness of fit and degree of interpretation. At the same time, the \ncomplexity of the models also significantly increased with Model5 \nhaving 20 equation terms, which is about twice as many as that found in \nthe first three models. However, the model estimation accuracy for the \ncalibration set did not significantly improve with the increase in vari-\nables. RMSE and MAPE of Model2 \u20135 had an improvement rating below \n15% compared to Model1. For the validation set, the estimation accu-\nracy of Model4 and Moldel5 decreased, indicating overfitting. Although \nthe estimation accuracy of models for the overall validation set did not \ndrop significantly compared to the calibration set, the model perfor -\nmance for validation samples in different seasons decreased with the \nlowest degree of interpretation recorded in the spring and winter (R2 <\n0.5, Table 2). The RMSE of Model1 for the spring validation samples increased by 40% compared to the overall validation set. The perfor -\nmance of Model2 and Model5 for summer samples also increased by \nover 30%. Only the RMSE of Model3 and Model4 increased <25% for \neach seasonal sample. For the winter validation samples, only the R2 of \nModel2 and Model3 is still 0.38. In summary, the performance of \nModel3 for the calibration set and the validation set was the best among \nthe five models (R2 >0.38, RMSE <6.35 \u03bcmol L\u00001, MAPE <25.32%). \nThe validation performance of Model3 for each season was also better \nthan other five models. Combined with its performance in the AIC value \nand the number of equation terms, Model 3 was selected as the cCO2 \nestimation model for lakes in the ML_YHR basins. The model \u2019s specific \ncoefficients and statistical information are shown in Table S2. \n3.2. Model performance \n3.2.1. Performance for field surveys \nFor field-satellite matchups, the model-estimated cCO2 showed good \nagreement with field-measured cCO2. They were distributed on both \nsides of the 1:1 line (R2 \u22480.7, RMSE <6.34 \u03bcmol L\u00001, and MAPE <\n24.68% in Fig. 4). Model estimates showed a slight underestimation for \nsamples with cCO2 larger than 30 \u03bcmol L\u00001. The mean daily cCO2 of \nsamples from one sampling campaign in one lake (matched within one \nday) also showed good consistency (R2 \u22480.75, RMSE <4.32 \u03bcmol L\u00001, \nMAPE <31.10%, Fig. 4 b). Relative bias for surveys with low cCO2 (<\n10 \u03bcmol L\u00001) were large because the average of limited samples was \nsusceptible to outliers. For matchup samples from lakes in different \ntrophic states (mesotrophic to highly eutrophic), model estimates also \nshowed good performance (R2 >0.64, RMSE <6.85 \u03bcmol L\u00001, MAPE <\n26.57%, Table S3). \nEstimated spatial cCO2 variations also agreed with the measured \ndata and prior knowledge (Fig. 5). For lake estuary areas, our model \nestimated a lower cCO2 than other areas because of the lower Chl-a and \nSecchi disk depth (ZSD) resulting from river inflows (Fig. 5 Lake Hongze \nand Gaoyou). Surface cCO2 in shallow lakes would also elevate due to \nthe vertical exchange of CO2-rich bottom water with sediment resus -\npension resulting from wind and wave disturbance in southeastern Lake \nTable 2 \nStatistical metrics of five candidate models for calibration and validation datasets.  \nDatasets Numbers Statistic Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 \nCalibration 150 Model Input Chl-a, Tw, \nZSD, \nAccuPAR Chl-a, Tw, ZSD, \nAccuPAR, iPAR Chl-a, Tw, ZSD, AccuPAR, \niPAR, Drs Chl-a, Tw, ZSD, AccuPAR, \niPAR, Ts Chl-a, Tw, ZSD, AccuPAR, \niPAR, ks \nAIC \u0000310.10 \u0000320.66 \u00a1330.68 \u0000338.93 \u0000346.60 \nNumber of \nterms 8.00 9.00 12.00 17.00 20.00 \nR2 0.67 0.70 0.73 0.75 0.76 \nRMSE 7.02 6.64 6.35 5.86 6.10 \nMAPE 26.85 25.26 24.68 23.32 23.77 \nMR 1.06 1.05 1.05 1.04 1.04 \nValidation Spring 15 RMSE 8.28 6.97 5.94 6.89 7.58 \nMAPE 25.97 19.70 18.81 21.92 22.61 \nMR 0.95 0.92 0.95 0.95 0.92 \nR2 \u00000.16 0.18 0.41 0.20 0.03 \nSummer 8 RMSE 5.08 6.76 4.26 4.46 5.48 \nMAPE 29.97 34.31 25.32 23.94 42.30 \nMR 1.07 1.03 1.09 1.04 1.23 \nR2 0.85 0.74 0.90 0.89 0.83 \nAutumn \n35 RMSE 3.37 4.60 3.04 4.04 6.30 \nMAPE 21.65 23.68 17.08 15.92 23.68 \nMR 0.95 0.95 1.00 1.00 0.96 \nR2 0.83 0.68 0.86 0.76 0.40 \nWinter 40 RMSE 6.65 5.99 5.95 7.55 8.46 \nMAPE 24.24 25.31 23.78 29.69 32.51 \nMR 1.01 1.06 1.05 1.02 0.91 \nR2 0.23 0.38 0.38 0.01 \u00000.24 \nAll 98 RMSE 5.89 5.78 4.96 6.17 7.39 \nMAPE 24.05 24.60 20.75 23.11 28.64 \nMR 0.99 1.00 1.02 1.00 0.96 \nR2 0.61 0.63 0.72 0.58 0.39  T. Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n8Taihu (Fig. 5). However, Low ZSD areas with high Chl-a would have \nrevealed a low cCO2 due to the increasing photosynthesis intensity with \nincreasing Chl-a in the northwestern bay of Lake Taihu (Fig. 5). Simi-\nlarly, low Chl-a areas with high ZSD would also have low cCO2, because \nthe depth-integrated primary production related to both Chl-a and ZSD, \nwhich also increased with the increasing ZSD (Behrenfeld and Falkowski, \n1997 ) (in the northeastern bay of Lake Taihu (Fig. 5). Moreover, the \nphotosynthesis intensity may be weaker than respiration under low- \ntemperature conditions during the winter months. Thus, higher cCO2 \nwould occur in areas with high Chl-a in winter (western Lake Chaohu, \nsoutheastern Lake Liangzi, Fig. 5). Our model worked well in these \ncomplex situations and displayed reasonable spatial patterns of cCO2. \nWe also used the same matchup dataset to recalibrate the model \ncoefficients of the cCO2 estimation model proposed by Qi et al. (2020) \nfor Lake Taihu (Taihu model). The input variables for the Taihu model \nwere Chl-a, Tw, Kd (PAR), and AccuPAR. The Kd (PAR) in this study was \nconverted from ZSD using the relationship proposed by Zhang et al. \n(2020) where Kd (PAR) =1.434 ZSD \u00000.982, while R2 =0.935 and p <\n0.001. The performance of the Taihu model was significantly lower than \nour model (R2 \u22480.35, RMSE \u22489.6 \u03bcmol L\u00001, MAPE \u224843%, Fig. 4 c), \nwith a considerable overestimation for low cCO2 matchups (<5 \u03bcmol \nL\u00001). The Taihu model also failed to estimate matchups with high cCO2 \n(>20 \u03bcmol L\u00001). Moreover, the mean daily cCO2 of samples from one \nfield survey (matched within one day) had large biases where RMSE \u2248\n8.61 \u03bcmol L\u00001, and MAPE \u224843.92% (Fig. 4 d), with a low and insig-\nnificant degree of interpretation for the variations of cCO2 (R2 <0.2 and \np >0.05). The Taihu model also estimated incorrect cCO2 spatial pat-\nterns in most sampled lakes compared with field data and our model \n(Fig. 5). Comparing the recalibrated Taihu model proved the limitations \nof the local trained model and advantages of our regional trained model. 3.2.2. Comparison between Sentinel-3 and Aqua MODIS in Lake Taihu \nCompared with the multi-year spatiotemporal variation of cCO2 in \nLake Taihu from 2016 to 2020 estimated by Aqua MODIS data using the \nmodel proposed by Qi et al. (2020) (Fig. 6 a, b), the results of our model \nwere consistent but with lower estimates. Sentinel-3-derived cCO2 \nshowed more details in places like the northwestern small bay and the \nsouthwestern river mouth due to better spatial resolution of OLCI. Lower \nestimates mainly occurred in the southwestern areas during winter and \nspring according to the time series of four virtual stations (Fig. 6 f). \nThese spatial differences between the two estimates may be due to the \ndifferences in observation times and uncertainties of satellite products. \nThe time difference between Sentinel-3 and Aqua observations is about \n3 h. This will lead to differences in the spatial patterns of water quality in \nLake Taihu (Qi et al., 2018 ; Chen et al., 2019b ), resulting in different \ncCO2 patterns. On the other hand, the lack of a critical band at 665 nm in \nthe case of MODIS would lead to uncertainties in long-term MODIS Chl-a \nretrieval (Cao et al., 2022b ; Shen et al., 2022 ). Uncertainties of Aqua- \nderived Chl-a products (R2 =0.75, MAPE =25.3%, RMSE =10.6 \u03bcg \nL\u00001 (Shi et al., 2015a )) could lead to overestimations (Qi et al., 2020 ). \nThe lower Chl-a in the southwestern area may also lead to a larger un-\ncertainty of Chl-a products, exacerbating the differences between the \nestimates of Aqua and Sentinel-3. Nevertheless, matchups in the four \nvirtual stations of two estimates showed that although there were dif-\nferences in RMSE =28.22 \u03bcmol L\u00001 and MAPE =46.72%, the overall \nconsistency was good (MR =1.03). These calculations proved that our \nmodel can reflect the multi-year cCO2 variations of a specific lake to \nensure the accuracy of cCO2 estimations in regional lakes. \n3.2.3.

Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n9showed that the given uncertainties of a single input variable had minor \neffects on model estimations, and the model could output stable and \nreliable results (Fig. 7, Table S4). The model was most sensitive to \nchanges in ZSD. The relative error of 40% ZSD could cause a 21.22% bias, \nwhile the estimated bias caused by the relative error of 30% ZSD was \nreduced by about 35% to only 13.67%. However, it was still slightly \nhigher than the estimated bias caused by other input variables under \nsimilar relative errors. Similarly, the estimated bias caused by the relative errors of PAR also increased by about 42% (to 15.59%) when the \nrelative error increased from 15% to 20%. The influence of Chl-a and Tw \non the estimation results did not change significantly with the increase \nof the relative errors, which were about 11%. The simulation results \nshowed that the uncertainty of ZSD can lead to overestimation of the \nmodel results (MR =1.15), especially when ZSD is <0.3 m, as shown in \nFig. 7 (c). The uncertainty of PAR when >50 Einstein m\u00002 d\u00001 would \nlead to an underestimation (MR =0.86), as shown in Fig. 7 (d). \nFig. 5.Spatial pattern comparison of cCO2 estimation models. The first column shows RGB images obtained from Sentinel-3 OLCI. The second and third columns \nshow satellite-derived Chl-a and ZSD, respectively. The fourth and fifth columns show satellite-estimated images of cCO2 based on our model and Qi et al. (2020) \nmodel, respectively. T. Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n10After considering the uncertainties of all input variables, the esti-\nmated bias of the model was still <25%, within the uncertainty of the \nmodel itself (Table S4). ZSD was still the input variable with the most \nsignificant impact on the estimation results. Simulation results with \nlarge bias are mainly those with a ZSD of <0.3 m as shown in Fig. 7 (e-h). \nNotably, the number of simulation results with high bias was reduced \nwhen the uncertainties of all variables were considered together, as \nopposed to considering the uncertainty of a single variable. Considering the lower MAPE of ZSD evaluated by Shen et al. (2020) and our field data \nat <33.43% and PAR products at ~10% shown in Fig.S2 (b) and Fig. S3 \n(b, c), the actual estimated bias caused by the uncertainties of input \nvariables may be similar to the results shown in Fig. 7 (e), which is \n<20% and distributed on both sides of the 1:1 line. In addition, quality \ncontrol during the generation of multi-year series data and the removal \nof extreme outliers can also ensure the reliability of the obtained multi- \nyear cCO2 dataset. \nFig. 6.Monthly spatial variation of cCO2 estimated by (a) our model using Sentinel-3 data and by (b) Qi et al.

Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n113.3. Spatiotemporal variations in the cCO 2 of lakes in the ML_YHR basins \nThe satellite-estimated annual mean cCO2 of 113 lakes with an area \nof >10 km2 in the ML_YHR basins from 2016 to 2021 was 18.01 \u00b12.64 \n\u03bcmol L\u00001, showing a weak difference between lakes (CV: 14.66%) \n(Fig. 8). After converting cCO2 into partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), the \nannual mean pCO2 was 402 \u00b1154 \u03bcatm, which was close to the atmo -\nspheric CO2 partial pressure (400 \u03bcatm). The annual mean cCO2 in the \nlakes of the Huai River Basin (21.04 \u00b11.93 \u03bcmol L\u00001 where N =24) was \nabout 18% higher than that of the lakes in the middle and lower reaches \nof the Yangtze River (17.20 \u00b12.17 \u03bcmol L\u00001 where N =89). \nOverall, the satellite-estimated cCO2 of lakes in the ML_YHR basins \nalso showed dramatic seasonal variations as shown in Fig. 8 (d, e), with a \nmean variation coefficient of the monthly mean cCO2 as high as 52.59%. \nEven though classified according to different criteria, the monthly mean \ncCO2 of the whole lake showed a seasonal variation pattern that was low \nin summer and autumn and high in winter and spring, indicating that the \nseasonal variation of algae mainly controls the seasonal variation of the \nlake cCO2 in the ML_YHR basins. The cCO2 of eutrophic lakes was higher \nthan that of the mesotrophic lakes in the winter months but lower than \nthat of mesotrophic lakes during other seasons. At the same time, this \ndifference would increase with the degree of eutrophication. Specif -\nically, in the summer and autumn months, the estuary areas of lakes \nshowed extremely high values of the cCO2, while the more eutrophic \nareas showed extremely low values of cCO2 as shown in Fig. 9 (b, c). \nConversely, the more eutrophic areas of lakes in spring and winter \nshowed relatively high cCO2 values, while the estuary areas had rela-\ntively low cCO2 values as shown in Fig. 9 (a, d). \nSpecifically, satellite-estimated spatial cCO2 variations for large \nlakes (>100 km2) with different trophic states showed dramatic but reasonable heterogeneity (Fig. 10). Satellite estimates showed high cCO2 \nnear the channel or estuary of rivers in lakes with a high river \u2013lake \nconnectivity, such as Lake Poyang, Lake Dongting, and Lake Hongze, as \nshown in Fig. 10 (a, c, d). It was consistent with previous studies where \ninputs of CO2-rich river water would raise the lake\u2019s cCO2 (Wey-\nhenmeyer et al., 2015 ). The medium eutrophic such as Lake Luoma and \nJunshan in Fig. 10 (e, f) were similar to the highly eutrophic northern \nbay of Lake Taihu in Fig. 7 (g) and the Western Lake Chaohu in Fig. 10 \n(h), showing strong seasonal variations (CV about 50%). For Lake Taihu, \nas is shown in Fig. 10 (g), satellite estimates reflected spatial differen -\ntiation of high cCO2 in the northern lake bay and low cCO2 in the middle \nand southern lake areas; This is consistent with long-term field moni -\ntoring (Xiao et al., 2020 ). Satellite-estimated cCO2 in the high Chl-a \nnorthern area was lower in summer and autumn and higher in winter \nand spring compared with Lake Taihu \u2019s low Chl-a central area as shown \nin Fig. 10 (g). Satellite-estimated cCO2 in Lake Chaohu also showed a \nsimilar seasonal variation between higher Chl-a western and lower Chl-a \nin the eastern area in Fig. 10 (h). Furthermore, the satellite-estimated \nannual mean cCO2 for Lake Chaohu was 21.27 \u03bcmol L\u00001 (range: \n12.00 \u201337.33 \u03bcmol L\u00001), which was consistent with the field sampling \nresults in the four quarters in 2017 with a range of 13.31 \u201355.47 \u03bcmol \nL\u00001, and an annual mean of 26.27 \u03bcmol L\u00001 (Qi et al., 2019 ). The \nspatiotemporal variations of cCO2 in lakes with different trophic states \nestimated by satellite data were in line with prior knowledge and reports \nfrom previous studies, indicating that the results were reliable for \nreconstructing the spatial and temporal variations of cCO2 in ML_YHR \nlakes. \nWhen divided into four classes according to trophic states, it was \nfound that the annual mean cCO2 of lakes significantly decreased in \ndifferent classes with the increased eutrophication degree (R2 =0.96, p \nFig. 8.Spatiotemporal variations of satellite-estimated cCO2 from 2016 to 2021 for lakes larger than 10 km2 in the study area.

Among them, 49% of the 47 highly \neutrophic lakes had an annual mean cCO2 lower than the concentration \nof CO2 atmospheric equilibrium, which tended to be weak atmospheric \nCO2 sinks. Moreover, 26% of the 19 medium eutrophic lakes have an \nannual mean cCO2 lower than the concentration of CO2 atmospheric \nequilibrium. In the remaining 47 light eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes, \nonly 9% of the lakes had an annual mean cCO2 lower than the concen -\ntration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium. For the monthly mean cCO2 \nvariations shown in Fig. 8 (d), as the degree of eutrophication increased, \nand the duration of the lake cCO2 lasted longer below the concentration \nof CO2 atmospheric equilibrium. The monthly cCO2 in the mesotrophic \nlakes were slightly lower than the concentration of CO2 atmospheric \nequilibrium in June, July, August, and November (summer and \nautumn), while the monthly cCO2 in highly eutrophic lakes could last for \nnearly half a year (May to November). In addition, the cCO2 of meso -\ntrophic lakes were lower than that of eutrophic lakes in the winter \nmonths, and the decreasing trend and magnitude of cCO2 in mesotrophic \nlakes in the spring were also lower than those of eutrophic lakes. \nWhen divided into four classes according to lake sizes, it was found \nthat the annual mean cCO2 of lakes in different classes significantly \nincreased with the increase of the lake size (R2 =0.97 and p <0.01), as \nshown in Fig. 11 (c, d). The mean cCO2 of large lakes (>500 km2) was \nabout 25% higher than those of small lakes (10\u201350 km2). Among them, only one of the 26 lakes above 100 km2 had an annual mean cCO2 lower \nthan the concentration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium. In contrast, 37 \nof the 87 (43%) lakes below 100 km2 have an annual mean cCO2 lower \nthan the concentration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium. Considering \neutrophic lakes account for the majority of both lake sizes (>100 km2 at \n66% and <100 km2 at 88%). Lake size seemed to be a factor that could \nsignificantly affect lake cCO2 levels in addition to trophic states. \n4.Discussion \n4.1. Why does our model work? \nThe production and consumption processes of dissolved CO2 in lake \nsurface water are mainly divided into endogenous and exogenous pro-\ncesses as shown in Fig. 12. These factors and processes mainly includes: \n(a) the direct input of carbon (mainly DIC and DOC) from the river and \nland to the lake (Weyhenmeyer et al., 2015 ), (b) the balance of CO2 and \nother DIC species in the carbonate system (Marc \u00b4e et al., 2015 ; Stets et al., \n2017 ), (c) the photochemical and microbial mineralization of dissolved \norganic matter in the water body, which produces CO2 (Tranvik et al., \n2009 ; Nydahl et al., 2019 ), (d) the mineralization of sediments that \nproduce CO2 and exchange it from the bottom to surface through up-\nwelling (Ducharme-Riel et al., 2015 ; Reed et al., 2018 ), (e) the \nFig. 9.Satellite-estimated seasonal variation of cCO2 for lakes larger than 10 km2 in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River ba-\nsins, China.

When coupled with each other, they \nwill jointly affect the spatial and temporal dynamics of the lake CO2. \nChl-a is an indicator of phytoplankton biomass in lakes. Under suitable \nconditions of temperature, light and ZSD, the increase of Chl-a will in-\ncrease the consumption of CO2 in photosynthesis, resulting in decreased \ncCO2 (Behrenfeld and Falkowski, 1997 ; Balmer and Downing, 2011 ). On \nthe other hand, environmental conditions, such as low temperatures in \nwinter, insufficient PAR, or underwater weak light conditions caused by \nlow ZSD would not be conducive to photosynthesis.

Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n15conditions, the biological respiration and metabolic intensity would be \ngreater than the photosynthesis intensity, resulting in a higher cCO2 \n(Kortelainen et al., 2006 ; Kosten et al., 2010 ; Marotta et al., 2014 ). In \nour cCO2 estimation model (Table S2), the previously mentioned effects \nof Chl-a on cCO2 were jointly constrained by Tw and ZSD through \nquadratic polynomial regression. The sensitivity analysis showed that \nZSD was the most sensitive parameter in lakes tested (Table S4), which \nwas different with the Taihu model where Chl-a was the most sensitive \n(Qi et al., 2020 ). It indicated that the effect of ZSD on photosynthesis in \nother less eutrophic lakes was greater than Chl-a, which was different \nfrom the highly eutrophic Lake Taihu. \nSimilarly, in addition to being an indicator of the underwater light \ncondition associated with algal photosynthesis (Deng et al., 2017 ; Qi \net al., 2020 ), Secchi disk depth (ZSD) also has the potential to predict the \nphysical mixing related to changes in cCO2 because the resuspensions of \nsediments are susceptible to water mixing in shallow lakes. Most of the \nlakes in the ML_YHR basins are shallow lakes (mean depth: 1.1\u20138.4 m), \nand the suspended particulate matter in lakes varies sharply (1\u2013300 mg \nL\u00001) and is susceptible to resuspension events caused by hydrodynamic \ndisturbances (Hou et al., 2017 ; Cao et al., 2020 ). Disturbances caused by \nriver inputs and vertical mixing of lake water can significantly affect the \ndynamics of lake suspended matter, affecting ZSD (Liu et al., 2020 ; Shen \net al., 2020 ). Both of these processes would increase surface cCO2 \n(Marotta et al., 2014 ; Podgrajsek et al., 2015 ; Weyhenmeyer et al., \n2015 ), making ZSD an indicator of cCO2. Water temperature could \nsignificantly affect various biogeochemical processes in water bodies \nand is a recognized predictor of CO2 (Sobek et al., 2005 ; Marotta et al., \n2009 ; Kosten et al., 2010 ). In the estimated model (Table S2), Tw \ninteracted with PAR and ZSD in addition to Chl-a, confirming its inter-\naction with various biogeochemical processes in the lake. \nDOC quality changing with trophic states makes DOC an unstable \npredictor of cCO2 in lakes. DOC in lakes mainly originate from exoge -\nnous (e.g., terrestrial inputs) and endogenous (e.g., phytoplankton) \nsources (Fig. 12). The exogenous DOC has been shown to be more \nbioactive and easier to be mineralized to CO2 (Weyhenmeyer et al., \n2012 ; K\u00a8ohler et al., 2013 ). In boreal forest lakes or low-productivity \nlakes, where exogenous DOC from terrestrial inputs dominates, DOC \nand CDOM were good indicators of lake CO2 (Sobek et al., 2005 ; Ray-\nmond et al., 2013 ; Klaus et al., 2019 ). The eutrophication would make \nrefractory endogenous DOC contribute more to the total DOC pool \n(Kothawala et al., 2014 ; Wen et al., 2022 ), weakening the relationship \nbetween DOC and cCO2 in lakes. The relationship between DOC and CO2 \nin China lakes was found insignificant in both a previous study (Wen \net al., 2017 ) and our measured data (Fig. S4 and p >0.05). In the context \nof increasing global lake eutrophication (Wang et al., 2018 ; Hou et al., \n2022 ), selecting the more derivable indicators such as Chl-a or ZSD as \ninput variables would be more beneficial for the cCO2 estimation model \nfor regional lakes when satellite-derived DOC or CDOM products are not \navailable (Kutser et al., 2015 ). Since indicators of organic matter com-\nponents and lake trophic states are usually optical active (e.g., CDOM \nabsorption spectral indexes, CDOM fluorescence indexes) (Zhang et al., \n2017 ; Wen et al., 2022 ). It might be great help to develop remote sensing \nmethods that allow lake classification into exogenous and endogenous \nclasses and then choose appropriate algorithms for deriving cCO2 from \nspace. \n4.2. Improvements and limitations \nAlthough our model has good overall performance, limitations still \nexist in some cases. Our model could explain about 70% of the variance \nof cCO2 with MAPE <25% for calibration and validation datasets (Fig. 4, \nTable 2). The remaining 30% of the unexplained variance may come \nfrom the inorganic carbon input of rivers, the CO2 production rate in \nsediments, and the decomposition rate of organic matter (Weyhenmeyer \net al., 2015 ). Although we hypothesize that ZSD can indirectly indicate \nthe effects of mixing between surface water and CO2-rich bottom water or river water, such complex hydrological processes may not be fully \npredicted by quadratic equations alone. In addition, the estimation ac-\ncuracy of our model decreases in winter and spring, with an R2 of only \nabout 0.4. This may be because photosynthesis of algae has less impact \non CO2 during periods of dormancy and germination of algae, resulting \nin a reduced degree of model interpretation of CO2 variation in these \nseasons. The model sensitivity analysis results showed that the model \nwas most sensitive to the uncertainty of ZSD (Table S4), especially for a \nZSD <0.3 m (Fig. 7). This suggested that the model may overfit the high \ncCO2 in a low ZSD case during calibration, which in turn leads to over-\nestimated cCO2. Nevertheless, when comprehensively considering the \nuncertainties of all input variables, the relative deviation of the model \u2019s \nestimates was <25%, and the relative deviation was only 15.98% under \nthe ideal accuracy of the input variable (Table S4), where no extreme \nabnormality has occurred. Based on the sensitivity analysis and statis -\ntical metrics of the model calibration and validation results (Table 2), \nthe estimated results of the model in this study could reflect reliable \nspatiotemporal variations of cCO2, with a small uncertainty of about \n25%, which is only half of the mean coefficient of variation of monthly \ncCO2. \nAdding time-related auxiliary variables to the model could also help \nimprove the model performance, in addition to satellite-derived vari-\nables. In previous studies, the time differences between sampling sites \nover a single field survey was usually ignored, and each sampling site \nwas used to represent lake cCO2 spatial variations. However, lake cCO2 \ncan vary dramatically on an hourly scale (Morales-Pineda et al., 2014 ; \nXu et al., 2019 ; Qi et al., 2020 ). Ignoring the temporal differences be-\ntween sampling sites can be misleading as the assumption is that the \ndifferences in cCO2 between sites consists only of spatial differences, \nwhich may hinder the development of the estimation model. For single \nlake studies, scheduled periodic sampling could mitigate this bias to a \ncertain extent (Xiao et al., 2020 ; Yan et al., 2021 ) and enable developing \nof higher-accuracy models (Qi et al., 2020 ). However, in regional or \nglobal studies, it is difficult to confirm the exact observation times of \nsampling sites in different surveys. Thus, time-related deviations in \nsamples may reduce the interpretation of critical cCO2 predictors, hin-\ndering the development of high-performance models. In this study, \nadding time-related variables improved the model \u2019s AIC, R2, and RMSE \nperformance in the calibration processes (Table 2). The model perfor -\nmance for validation samples also significantly improved, with an \noverall RMSE reduction of 17% and a 28% for the spring samples. These \nresults show that the addition of time-related variables is of great help to \nthe development of an cCO2 estimation model for regional lakes. \nMoreover, it also proved that the time differences between sampling \nsites have a non-negligible effect on analyzing the spatial and temporal \nvariation of the CO2 in the regional lakes. \nIn the field-satellite matchup dataset used for model calibration and \nvalidation in this study, the Chl-a level was mesotrophic or eutrophic \n(26.97 \u00b121.34 \u03bcg L\u00001), while ZSD was at a low level compared with \nglobal lakes (0.36 \u00b10.18 m, with a conservative global estimate of 1.88 \n\u00b11.24 m (He et al., 2022 )). Therefore, the model in this study is theo-\nretically applicable to eutrophic turbid lakes. For low-productivity lakes, \nthe related biological processes affecting cCO2 are not dominated by \nalgae. This type of lakes mainly act as the decomposition place of \nterrestrial organic matter, resulting in a better relationship between \ncCO2 and DOC and CDOM (Sobek et al., 2003 ). For deep-water lakes \nwith a relatively steady mixing regime (Woolway and Merchant, 2019 ), \nit is difficult for sediment resuspension to occur, making the ZSD unable \nto predict CO2 variations resulting from vertical mixing. For saline lakes, \nthe carbonate balance controlled by physical and chemical parameters \nsuch as water temperature and salinity may have more significant im-\npacts on cCO2 (Li et al., 2021 ), making the input variables of our model \ninsufficient for predicting this process. Therefore, the basic assumptions \nof our model do not apply to the types of lakes mentioned in this \nparagraph, which can hinder the direct application of the model on a \nglobal scale. T. Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n16In addition to the uncertainty of the cCO2 estimation model itself, \nsome potential cCO2 dynamics that optical remote sensing could not \ncapture raised the uncertainty in the estimation of lake cCO2. For \nexample, because optical sensors cannot acquire water-leaving infor-\nmation under cloud cover, short-term and intense CO2 variations \naccompanying the clouds or precipitation would be missing (Ojala et al., \n2011 ). Similarly, optical sensors cannot acquire water-leaving infor-\nmation under algal scums and aquatic vegetation, where potentially \nmore dramatic dynamics in cCO2 have been reported (Bolpagni et al., \n2007 ; Ouyang et al., 2017 ). Algae and macrophytes have intense \nphotosynthesis and consume lots of CO2 during their growth and \ndevelopment, while their residues decay and decompose thereby pro-\nducing a large amount of CO2 after they die. However, due to the \nshading or interference of algal scums and macrophytes to the acquisi -\ntion of radiative information on lake water, it is difficult to derive the \nlake environment parameters correctly, which brings challenges to the \nremote sensing estimation of cCO2 in these areas. In this study, only \nabout 10% of the pixels were masked as algal scums and macrophytes \nwith a high frequency (>20%, Fig. S5). This indicates that the \nremaining 90% pixels represent the opportunity to evaluate cCO2 dy-\nnamics in ML_YHR lakes. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to develop \nnew approaches to remotely estimate cCO2 in these masked areas to \nadvance knowledge of lake CO2 dynamics in further research. \n4.3. Opportunities and challenges \nThere may be dramatic spatiotemporal variations of lake cCO2 be-\ntween lakes and within lakes (Fig. 9), which is hard to monitor through \ntraditional discrete and low-frequency field samplings. The lack of suf-\nficient spatiotemporal coverage on global lakes has been an essential \nsource of uncertainties in previous estimates of global lake CO2 emis-\nsions (Raymond et al., 2013 ; Holgerson and Raymond, 2016 ). For the \n113 study lakes in the ML_YHR basins, a relative deviation of about 35% \nin the estimated mean value of cCO2 could occur if only one lake was \nselected to represent the entire number of regional lakes. Further \nconsideration of cCO2 seasonal variations could cause the range of the \nestimated mean cCO2 to be close to three times the reference regional \nmean value (mean relative deviation: 61%, range: \u000091% to 186%), with \nsignificant uncertainties. Although there was a relative uncertainty of \n25% in the results based on our satellite estimation model, it was only \nabout half of the mean potential uncertainty in the field-based estimates. \nThe remote sensing approach has great potential in reducing un-\ncertainties of monitoring and evaluating CO2 emissions from regional or \nglobal lakes. \nSatellite remote sensing is one of the few approaches to monitoring \nhighly heterogeneous regional or global lake CO2 dynamics at a rela-\ntively low cost. It is difficult to eliminate the time difference between \nsampling sites during field sampling, and differences in CO2 between \nsampling sites often result from both temporal and spatial differences. \nEven for automated navigation samplings conducted by unmanned \nboats, three hours were needed to monitor a lake of about 40 km2 (Loken \net al., 2019 ). The high-frequency lake CO2 emissions monitoring \nnetwork could only obtain a rough overview of spatial patterns repre -\nsenting lake CO2 emissions; however, this overview came with high \nconstruction and maintenance costs (Lee et al., 2014 ). In contrast, sat-\nellite imaging time for large areas is instantaneous compared to field \nsampling. The average cost of satellite data is low because massive \nglobal data can be obtained after the launch. This study proved that \nadding time-related variables to the estimation model could mitigate the \ncoupling of temporal differences in the field cCO2 data, which enabled \nthe acquisition of a more realistic spatial variation of lake cCO2. In \nfurther research, more field-satellite matched data from multi-type lakes \nshould be obtained with within a time difference less than three hours. \nOther satellite sensors, besides Sentinel-3 OLCI, have the potential to \ninvestigate lake CO2 emissions. For example, the Aqua MODIS data time \nseries is over 20 years long. However, it is challenging to quantify pigments like Chl-a in inland waters because MODIS does not have \nspectral bands in the red part of the spectrum, which is critical to \ndetecting Chl-a in inland and coastal waters (Cao et al., 2022b ). The \nLandsat series data can extend the observation to 1984 (nearly 40 years). \nIts high spatial resolution (30 m) is suitable for monitoring small lakes \n(1\u201310 km2), which cannot be mapped with moderate resolution sensors \n(e.g., MODIS, OLCI) (Palmer et al., 2015 ). However, the 8-bit radio -\nmetric resolution of sensors before Landsat-8 is not sufficient for map-\nping water quality parameters (Kutser, 2012 ). Moreover, considering \nthe cloud cover, the longer revisit period of high-resolution satellites (e. \ng., Landsat ~16 days) does not allow data acquisition at a sufficient \nfrequency (Klaus et al., 2019 ). However, Sentinel-2 allows lake sampling \nwith a 5-day revisit time (with a shorter time at higher latitudes) and \nwith high spatial resolution (10 m). Sentinel-2 has also proved it possible \nto map lake Chl-a and DOC (Toming et al., 2016 ). Thus, future research \nmay rely on the virtual constellation of high-resolution satellites (e.g., \nSentinel-2A and B, Landsat-8 and 9) to help overcome this problem (Cao \net al., 2022a ). \nDifferent satellite sensors have accumulated massive earth observa -\ntion data. However, applying this data for lake CO2 mapping is still \nchallenging. More research is needed to make the full use of this data. \nFurthermore, the high-frequency data of geostationary satellites (e.g., \nCMOS, Himawari-8) should be used to further develop a spatiotempo -\nrally coupled CO2 estimation model, which may help further eliminate \nthe effects of time-related differences coupled in the field data. These \nimprovements have the potential to significantly advance our under -\nstanding of the lake carbon cycle and correctly estimate lake carbon \nbudgets although it will not be possible to use geostationary satellites at \nhigher latitudes where most of the world lakes occur. \nAlthough the model proposed in this study cannot adequately cover \nall types of lakes due to insufficient field-satellite matched data in other \nregions, many lakes worldwide meet our model \u2019s theoretical assump -\ntions, indicating its huge application potential. About 80% of global \nlakes have an average water depth of <5 m (Messager et al., 2016 ), \nsimilar to the lakes in the ML_YHR basins. They are easily disturbed by \nwind and waves, which aligns with the use of ZSD as an indicator of cCO2. \nIn addition, >60% of global lakes are already eutrophic( Wang et al., \n2018 ), and the potential of Chl-a as an indicator of lake CO2 has also \nbeen confirmed in other eutrophic lakes with high productivity in \nAmerica (Balmer and Downing, 2011 ; Pacheco et al., 2014 ) and Africa \n(Borges et al., 2022 ). The many achievements in using different satellite \ndata to retrieve Chl-a and ZSD, or their related indicators in global lakes \n(He et al., 2022 ; Pahlevan et al., 2022 ) also provided good cause for \nfurther research. \nFurther promotion and validation of our model on a global scale can \nlead to great opportunities and challenges. The promotion and expan -\nsion of the authors \u2019 proposed model will open new doors to under -\nstanding carbon cycles of different types of lakes in climatic zones \naround the world; however, the model coefficients must be recalibrated \nto achieve this. The proposed model may even have to be re-retrained \nwith more indicators. For example, in cold and low-productivity \nboreal lakes, the role played by the photosynthesis of phytoplankton \nmay be replaced by the mineralization of organic matter (Sobek et al., \n2003 ). The dominant predictor of cCO2 would be DOC or in the case of \nremote sensing it\u2019s coloured component, CDOM. For saline lakes similar \nto oceans, the effect of the carbonate balance on cCO2 is enhanced (Li \net al., 2021 ), and salinity might be essential to the model to constrain the \nrelated process. \nWith the development of high-precision satellite products featuring \nlake CO2 key factors and the acquisition of more field data, sophisticated \nalgorithms developed with the help of machine learning (Chen et al., \n2019a ), and semi-analytical algorithms (Bai et al., 2015 ) have the great \npotential to develop cCO2 models with higher performance. It is even \npossible to establish a general cCO2 model for global lakes, leading to a \nmore accurate estimation of global lake CO2 emissions. T. Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n175.Conclusions \nIn this study, a stepwise quadratic polynomial cCO 2 estimation \nmodel for lakes in the ML_YHR basins was constructed using the field- \nmeasured cCO 2 data and the Sentinel-3-derived Chl-a, ZSD, Tw, iPAR, \nAccuPAR, and Drs as input variables. Satellite-derived Chl-a, ZSD, Tw, \nand PAR products are good cCO 2 predictors for lakes in the ML_YHR \nbasins with conditions ranging from mesotrophic to highly eutrophic. \nBesides, adding time-related auxiliary variables to constrain the model \nalso helped improve model performance. Our model was the most sen-\nsitive to the uncertainty of ZSD products, indicating the dominant effect \nof ZSD on photosynthesis and mixing in regional meso-eutrophic shallow \nlakes. The reconstructed multi-year cCO 2 spatiotemporal dynamics of \nlakes in the ML_YHR basins showed dramatic seasonal variations, which \nwere low in the summer and autumn but high in the winter and spring. \nThe annual mean cCO 2 of ML_YHR lakes decreased with the increase in \nthe eutrophication degree and with the decrease in lake sizes. This study \nis the first estimate and the reconstruction of multi-year cCO 2 covering \nregional lakes using satellite data, which proves the application poten -\ntial of the remote sensing approach in large-scale lake CO2 emission \nestimations. In future research, field-satellite matched data from \ndifferent types of lakes and more high-precision satellite-derived CO2 \nindicators should be added to improve the model performance. We \nbelieve the remote sensing approach will contribute to further reducing \nuncertainty in global lake CO2 emission estimates. This contribution can \nalso better track CO2 emissions and thereby add to the knowledge base \nneeded to solve the eutrophication problem worldwide. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nTianci Qi: Methodology, Software, Writing \u2013 original draft.
