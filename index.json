A sphere \ncontact quantification model was developed to estimate the concentration of contact between them for any \nsimple random mixture. Comparing the evolution of gain of CO conversion (or hydrocarbon yield) with the \ntheoretical results, it was shown that the density of contact was identified as the key factor for the catalytic \nperformances (contact-activity relationship). Finally, the knowledge of the contact morphology, determined by \nFEG-SEM, allowed proposing the NH3-TPD as method characterizing the concentration of contact.   \n1.Introduction \nLight (C2-C4) hydrocarbons are important chemical building blocks \nfor a variety of useful derivatives in the petrochemical and chemical \nindustries [1,2] . They are presently produced worldwide in huge \namounts mostly by steam cracking of naphta which is highly \nenergy-consuming process. C2-C4 hydrocarbons synthesis from syngas \n(a mixture of CO and H2) is attractive since renewable carbon resources \n(biomass, wastes, CO2) are expected to gradually replace fossil fuels [3]. \nFischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis is the traditional process of converting \nsyngas to hydrocarbons [4]. However, the FT process is limited by the \nAnderson\u0000Schultz\u0000Flory (ASF) distribution and contain a small yield of \nC2-C4 hydrocarbons [5,6] . \nA two-step process including methanol synthesis (Reaction 1) fol-\nlowed by methanol-to-olefins (MTO, Reaction 2) process is commer -\ncially available to produce light hydrocarbons but development of a \nmore energetically and costly-efficient direct process is needed [7]. \nCO+2H2\u21ccCH 3OH (Reactionn 1)  \nnCH 3OH\u2192CnH2n+nH 2O (Reactionn 2) \nThe advantage of the single-step process is the achievement of both reactions (Reactions 1 and 2) in one reactor in order to simplify the \nprocess route and equipment [4]. This process is possible using a \nso-called hybrid or bifunctional catalyst. The bifunctional catalyst cor-\nresponds to a physical mixture of methanol synthesis catalyst (Cu-Z -\nnO-Al 2O3) and zeotype (SAPO-34), can lead to the formation of light \nhydrocarbons from syngas via methanol as reactional intermediate [4,8, \n9]. The main advantage of the single-step process is the elimination of \nthe restriction of methanol synthesis by the thermodynamic equilibrium \nshift (drain-off mechanism) [10]. It can be assumed therefore that the \nproximity between methanol synthesis catalyst and SAPO-34 (where the \nmethanol is converted) plays a significant role in the catalytic perfor -\nmances (high. CO conversion) and in the hydrocarbon selectivity [9]. \nIn the present work, we investigated the activity of hybrid catalyst \nfor the CO hydrogenation into hydrocarbons (HC) as a function con-\ncentration of contact between methanol synthesis catalyst (M1) and \nSAPO-34 (M2). In order to evaluate the effect of the proximity between \nM1 and M2, different catalytic bed dispositions (layer bed, denoted LB, \nand simple random mixture, denoted SRM) of both components have \nbeen adopted. Using a similar methodology as previously described [11, \n12], we built contact \u2013reactivity relationship on the basis of catalytic \nobservations. The results led us to formulate hypotheses concerning the \nmorphology of the contacts, as well as the development of a \n*Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: anthony.le.valant@univ-poitiers.fr (A.

Experimental data were compared with theo-\nretical calculations to validate the model. Finally, the knowledge of the \ncontact morphology, determined by field emission gun scanning elec-\ntron microscope (FEG-SEM), allowed proposing a method to charac -\nterize the concentration of contact of each hybrid catalyst. \n2.Materials and methods \n2.1. Materials \n2.1.1. Methanol synthesis catalyst \nA commercially available methanol synthesis copper-based catalyst \n(M1) was used. This is a material developed by Johnson Matthey and \nsold by Alfa Aesar (a Johnson Matthey company) in the form of \n5.4mm\u00d73.6mm pellets. These pellets were crushed and sized to \n160\u0000100 \u00b5m (in this form, the apparent density of the M1 (denoted \n\u03c1M1) material is equal to 1.23 gcm-3 and the radius of the M1 material is \nrM1 =65.0 \u00b5m). \n2.1.2. SAPO-34 \nA SAPO-34 zeolite (M2) in the form of fine powder was purchased \nfrom ACS Material. It was pelletized, crushed and sized to 160\u0000100 \u00b5m \n(in this form, the apparent density of the M2 (denoted \u03c1M2) material is \nequal to 0.94 gcm-3 and the radius of the M2 material is rM2 =65.0 \u00b5m). \n2.1.3. Hybrid catalysts \n2.1.3.1. Layer bed arrangements. The layer bed arrangements (denoted \nxLB(y), where x and y represent the number of layers and the number of \ncontacts, in terms of contact section between M1 and M2, respectively) \nare presented in the Table S1. The same amount of M1 (160\u0000100 \u00b5m) \nand M2 (160\u0000100 \u00b5m) reference materials was used for each of LB arrangement. The differences between the LB arrangements are the \nnumber of alternating layers between M1 and M2, resulting a change in \nthe number of contacts (see Table S1). \n2.1.3.2. Simple random mixture arrangements. The simple random \nmixture arrangements (denoted SRM(x), where x represents the M2 \nproportion) were prepared by simple mixing M1 (160\u0000100 \u00b5m) and M2 \n(160\u0000100 \u00b5m) reference materials with different weight ratios. The \ncharacteristics of SRM arrangements are presented in the Table S2. \n2.2. Characterization of materials \nThe morphology of the M1, M2 and reduced SRM(0.50) (reduced in \nthe same conditions as the catalytic test, see paragraph 2.3) catalysts \nwere studied using a field emission gun scanning electron microscope \n(FEG-SEM) 7900F from JEOL. This microscope is equipped with an \nEnergy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS) from Bru\u00a8cker (with Esprit \nsoftware) allowing the mapping of the Cu, Zn, Al, Mg, Si, P, O and C \ncontents. \nInductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) \nwas used for the determination of the metal content in M1 and M2 \nsamples. The measurements were performed with a Perkin Elmer Op-\ntima 2000DV spectrometer. The M1 sample was previously dissolved in \nan acidic mixture of HNO 3 and HCl to perform the analyses for Cu, Zn, Al \nand Mg. The M2 sample was dissolved into H2SO4 +HNO 3 +HF at \nboiling point to perform the analyses for Al and P. For the Si determi -\nnation, the solid was fused with lithium tetraborate into a Pt-Au crucible \nat 1100\u25e6C. The obtained solid was then dissolved into HCl. \nThe textural properties of the M1 and M2 catalysts were determined \nby adsorption \u2013desorption of nitrogen at the temperature of liquid ni-\ntrogen (\u0000196\u25e6C, 77K) using a Micromeritics Tristar and ASAP 2000 \ninstruments. Before measuring, the M1 was degassed at 250\u25e6C for 4h \nand the M2 was heated at 350\u25e6C overnight. The SBET surface areas were \nFig. 1.FEG-SEM images (a and b) and EDX mapping analysis (c) of M1 catalyst.  V. L\u2019hospital et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n3calculated according to the method of Brunauer, Emmet and Teller \n(BET). The Smicro surface area and Vmicro volume pore of M2 catalyst \nwere determined with the t-plot method. The Sexter external surface area \ncorresponds to the difference between SBET and Smicro and the Vexter \nexternal pore volume to the difference between the total pore volume \nand the Vmicro. \nIn situ X-ray diffractograms were carried out using a D8 advance \ndiffractometer in Bragg-Brentano configuration equipped with a Cu \nanode (Cu K\u03b1 radiation: 0.154184 nm) and a LynxEye XET 1-D detector. \nThe samples were mounted in an atmosphere-controlled Anton Paar \nXRK 900 reactor chamber. X-ray diffractograms were recorded in pure \nH2 (20mL\u22c5min-1) before and after reduction at 400\u25e6C for 30min with a \nstep of 0.03\u25e6(2\u03b8) and a counting time per step of 2s \nA Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 apparatus was employed for the \ntemperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurement. Approxi -\nmately 100mg of freshly M1 catalyst was introduced between two \nquartz wool balls into a quartz U-shaped tube. The TPR experiments was \ncarried out in 10% H2/Ar flowing at a rate of 30 NmL min-1 with a \ntemperature increase from 30\u25e6to 400\u25e6C at 5\u25e6Cmin-1 using a pro-\ngrammable temperature controller. Hydrogen consumption was moni -\ntored by a TCD detector. \nThe ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH 3-TPD) \nmeasurement was undertaken using a homemade apparatus equipped \nwith a TCD detector. For the analysis, 250mg of catalyst (M1, M2, LB \nand SRM arrangements) was placed in quartz reactor between two \nquartz wool layers. The catalyst was pretreated as follows: the temper -\nature of the catalyst bed was increased to 400\u25e6C (5\u25e6Cmin-1) under a H2 \nflow (30 NmL min-1) and this temperature was maintained for 30min. \nNext, the sample was purged with He at the same temperature and \nduration. Finally, the catalyst was cooled down to 100\u25e6C and this temperature was maintained for 30min. Adsorption of ammonia was \nthen carried out at 100\u25e6C for 60min. After purging with helium for \n60min, the analysis was carried out at a heating rate of 10\u25e6Cmin-1 from \n100\u25e6to 700\u25e6C. \nIn situ DRIFT spectra were achieved with a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spec-\ntrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with Praying Mantis \u2122 High \nTemperature Reaction Chamber (Harrick, model HVC-DRP-4) and MCT \ndetector cooled by liquid N2. The spectral resolution was 4cm-1. The \ntemperature gradient between the regulation thermocouple and the \nupper part of the powder sample was previously determined and cor-\nrected. The samples were firstly pre-treated at 400\u25e6C under 20mL.min-1 \nof He flow for 1h before NH3 chimisorption under 30mL.min-1 of 1% \nNH3-He flow and purging under 20mL.min-1 of He flow for 1h. Spectra \nwere then recorded from room temperature up to 400\u25e6C. \n2.3. Catalysis \nCatalytic performances of M1, M2, LB and SRM arrangements were \ncompared in a continuous fixed-bed stainless steel reactor (L =400mm, \n\u00d8int =6.35 mm). The details of the different arrangements used in this \nstudy are illustrated in Tables S1 and S2. For 2LB(0) arrangement, M1 \nand M2 were separated with a layer of SiC (0.60 g). \nBefore reaction, the catalyst was pre-treated in situ at 400\u25e6C for \n30min (heating rate of 5\u25e6Cmin-1) under a flow of pure H2 (1.8 NL h-1) \nat atmospheric pressure. Then, the reactor was purged with argon and \nthe pressure was increased to 30bar. The reactor was then flushed with \nthe reactant gas mixture (H2/CO/Ar:53/21/26, 6 NL h-1) at 400\u25e6C. The \noutlet flow was decompressed and periodically injected in an Agilent \n7890 A gas chromatograph (GC) connected online. All the lines con-\nnecting the reactor with the GC were kept at 200\u25e6C to avoid product \nFig. 2.FEG-SEM images (a and b) and EDX mapping analysis (c) of M2 catalyst .  V. L\u2019hospital et al.

The GC was equipped with three channels: the first one \nconsisted of two series connected of HP PLOT 5A molecular sieve col-\numn (for H2 and CO) and a HP PLOT Q molecular sieve column (for CO2 \nand H2O) connected to a TCD detector, while the second channel con-\nsisted of a HP INNOWAX capillary column (for methanol) connected to a \nFID detector and finally the third channel consisted of a GS-Q capillary \ncolumn (for hydrocarbons) connected to another FID detector. \nThe CO conversion was calculated using the following equation \n(Eq.1): \nXCO(%)=FCO,in\u0000FCO,out\nFCO,in\u00d7100 (1)  \nwhere FCO,in and FCO,out are the molar inlet and outlet CO flows. \nThe selectivity to a product (i) is calculated by comparing the molar \nflow of the product (i) and the total amount of CO converted (Eq.2): \nSi=ni\u00d7 F i\nFCO,in\u0000 FCO,out\u00d7100 (2)  \nwhere ni and Fi are the carbon atom numbers in the product (i) and the \nmolar flow of the product (i). 3.Results and discussions \n3.1. M1 and M2 characterizations \n3.1.1. Morphological, textural and physicochemical properties of methanol \nsynthesis catalyst (M1) \nFEG-SEM images of the M1 commercial methanol synthesis catalyst \nare shown in Fig. 1. The morphology of catalyst M1 behaves like \nirregular particles. Fig. 1 shows the results of EDX elemental analysis of \nthe obtained M1 material. The oxygen, aluminum, copper, zinc, mag-\nnesium and carbon elements were detected. \nThe composition of the M1 commercial methanol catalyst was also \ndetermined by ICP-OES: the weight percentages of CuO, ZnO, Al2O3 and \nMgO are 55.3, 21.7, 7.8 and 1.1wt% (the missing 14.1 wt% corre -\nsponding to carbon and water), respectively (Table S3). \nThe BET surface area (SBET)and pore volume (Vexter) of the M1 \ncompound are approximately 97m2 g-1 and 0.20 cm3 g-1 (Table S3), \nrespectively. \nXRD patterns of fresh and reduced M1 are shown in Fig. S1. Fresh M1 \ncatalyst exhibit crystallized phases of CuO (tenorite structure), ZnO \n(zincite structure), (Cu0.8Zn0.2)2(OH) 2(CO 3) (zincian malachite struc-\nture) and carbon (graphitic structure). No phase containing Al2O3 or \nMgO was detected with XRD, due likely to amorph forms. After reduc -\ntion under H2 at 400\u25e6C, CuO is fully reduced to metallic copper whereas \nZnO stays in its zincite form. \nThe reducibility of M1 catalyst was also evaluated by H2-TPR. The \nTPR profile is shown in Fig. S2. This profile is characterized by the main \npeak centered at 241\u25e6C and ascribed to the reduction of CuO to metallic \nCu. The amount of H2 consumption (VH2) and the H2/Cu ratio are re-\nported in Table S3. According to the stoichiometry of the CuO reduction \n(CuO+H2\u2192Cu+H2O), the value of H2/Cu molar ratio, equal to one, \nFig. 3.Evolution of (a) the conversion and (b) the selectivity values and the P/ \nO ratio versus the number of contacts in LB arrangements at 15h of reaction. \nReaction conditions: m(M1+M2)=1.20 g, P=30bar, T=400\u25e6C, H2/CO/ \nAr=53/21/26, WHSV(xLB(y))=5L.h-1.g-1 and WHSV(for M1 alone)=10L.h- \n1.g-1 (the P/O ratio represents the proportion of paraffins relative to olefins). \nFig. 4.Evolution of the conversion (a) and evolution of the selectivity values \nand the P/O ratio (b) versus the M2 content in SRM arrangements at 15h of \nreaction.

L\u2019hospital et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n5indicates that 100% of copper is reduced to a metallic state under the \nreaction conditions, which is in accordance with the reduced M1 XRD \nmeasurement. \n3.1.2. Morphological and textural properties of SAPO-34 (M2) \nThe morphology of the M2 SAPO-34 commercial material is shown in \nFig. 2. The M2 grains behave like a stack of micro-scale cubes (Fig. 2a \nand b). This cubic morphology is characteristic of the chabazite \nstructure. \nFig. 2c shows the results of EDX elemental analysis of the M2 ma-\nterial. The oxygen, aluminum, silicon, and phosphorus elements were \ndetected. As can be seen, the distribution of the elements is very ho-\nmogenous on the surface of M2 sample. The composition of the M2 \nSAPO-34 commercial material, determined by ICP-OES, is 8.9, 34.1 and \n36.1 wt% (the missing 20.9 wt% corresponding to water) for SiO2, \nAl2O3 and P2O5, respectively (Table S4), with a Si/Al ratio equal to 0.22. \nThe XRD pattern, displayed in Fig. S3, shows the typical diffraction \npeaks assigned to the chabazite structure at 9.6, 13.2, 16.2, 20.8, 26.0, \nand 31.1\u25e6. The SBET surface area and the Vexter external pore volume of \nthe M2 are approximately 475m2 g-1 and 0.03 cm3 g-1 (Table S4). The \nSmicro surface area and the Vmicro micropore volume are 463m2 g-1 and \n0.23 cm3 g-1, respectively. \n3.2. Catalytic performances \n3.2.1. M1+M2 arrangements \n3.2.1.1. Catalytic performances with layered bed (LB) arrangements. The \nimpact of the contact concentration between M1 and M2 is investigated \nusing the different layered bed arrangements present in the Table S1. \nThe performance of M1 and different catalytic layered bed arrangements \nat 15h of reaction is shown in Fig. 3 (the evolution of the CO conversion \nand the product selectivities versus the time on stream is presented in \nFig. S4). The M1 catalyzed the conversion of syngas to CH4, CO2 and \nhydrocarbons (denoted HC, mostly C2H6) with selectivities of approxi -\nmately 45%, 40% and 10%, respectively. The CO conversion (denoted \nXCO) is approximately 7% (with WHSV=10L.h-1.g-1, see Fig. 3a); and methanol (denoted MeOH) and dimethylether (denoted DME) traces are \nobserved (Fig. 3b). These results clearly indicate that, under our \nexperimental conditions, M1 favors the methanation and Water Gas \nShift (WGS) reactions at the expense of methanol synthesis reaction, \nwhich is also in agreement with the thermodynamic equilibrium data \npresented in Table S5. No activity is observed for M2 alone (not pre-\nsented here). When the M2 catalyst is associated with the M1 catalyst, \nwithout contact (2LB(0) arrangement, where M1 and M2 are separated \nfrom each other by a 1cm thick layer of SiC), the CO conversion (Fig. 3a) \nand the CH4 and CO2 selectivities (Fig. 3b) are not changed compared to \nthe test with the M1 catalyst alone. However, the disappearance of \nMeOH and DME is observed in favor of hydrocarbons. When the both \ncatalysts are in contact (2LB(1), 4LB(3), 6LB(5), 8LB(7) and 10LB(9) \narrangements), an increase in CO conversion (Fig. 3a) and HC selectivity \n(mostly C3H8) and a decrease in CH4 selectivity are observed (Fig. 3b, \nthe CO2 selectivity is constant for all the catalytic tests). This phenom -\nenon is amplified with the increase in the number of contacts between \nM1 and M2 layers. The formation of hydrocarbons is explained by the \ntransformation of methanol intermediate formed over M1 into hydro -\ncarbons over M2 acid sites, thus inhibiting the CO methanation and/or \nthe hydrogenation of MeOH into CH4 over M1[13]. The intimacy be-\ntween both materials leads to a strong increase in the proportion of \nparaffins relative to olefins (see the P/O ratio in Fig. 3b), indicating the \nhydrogenation of the olefins. Hydrogen spillover (from M1 to M2) \nand/or olefins spillover (from M2 to M1) and/or the hydrogenation of \nolefins by crossing through a layer of M1 would probably explain this \n[14,15] . \nIt is possible to estimate the gain of CO conversion (denoted XCOgain ), \ninduced by the proximity between M1 and M2, by subtracting the CO \nconversion value of the xLB(y) catalyst (denoted XCO) with the value of \nM1 catalyst (denoted XCOM1), according with the following equation \nEq.3:  \nXCOgain =XCO - XCOM1                                                                   (3) \nwith XCOM1 =7%. \nThe XCOgain (see Fig. 3a) scales linearly with the number of contacts, \nwith an interception at zero. This result clearly evidences that the \nFig. 5.(a) two-dimensional multicomponent packing, (b) tetrahedral subunits (Orange and yellow spheres represent M1 and M2, respectively.), (c) evolution of \ncontact concentrations and (d) evolution of the normalized M1-M2 contact concentration and the normalized XCOgain of SRM versus M2 content (with \nrM1=rM2=65.0 \u00b5m, \u03c1M1=1.23gcm\u00003 and \u03c1M2=0.94gcm\u00003). V. L\u2019hospital et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n6XCOgain is directly correlated with the M1-M2 contact concentration. \nThis proximity eliminates restriction of methanol synthesis by the \nthermodynamic equilibrium shift and enhanced the CO conversion (and \ntherefore the production of HC). \n3.2.1.2. Catalytic performances with simple random mixture (SRM) \narrangements. In order to improve the CO conversion, different simple \nrandom mixtures of M1 and M2 were made. Different compositions of \nthese SRM arrangements were used to vary the contact concentration \nbetween M1 and M2. The same total amount of M1+M2 catalysts was \nused for each of SRM arrangement. The characteristics of SRM ar-\nrangements are presented in the Table S2. \nThe impact of the composition of the SRM arrangement at 15h of \nreaction is illustrated in Fig. 4 (the evolution of the CO conversion and \nthe product selectivities versus the time on stream is presented in \nFig. S5). The conversion of CO as a function of the M2 proportion pre-\nsents a volcano-type profile (Fig. 4a). No activity is observed for M2 and \nlittle for M1 (XCO=11.2% with WHSV=5L.h-1.g-1), while their combi -\nnation demonstrates synergy, with a maximal CO conversion \n(XCO=54.1%, which is much higher than the CO conversions obtained \nwith the LB arrangements) located around 50% of M2 proportion. When \nthe M2 proportion increases (see Fig. 4b), the HC (mostly C3H6) selec-\ntivity quickly increases (until a plateau around 50% of M2 content) at the expense of the CH4 selectivity while the CO2 selectivity is constant \nfor all the catalytic tests (\u224840%). The proportion of paraffins also \npresents a volcano-type profile with a maximum located around 50% of \nM2. \nWith the same approach as the LB arrangements, it is possible to \nestimate the gain of CO conversion (denoted XCOgain ), for each SRM \ncomposition (using Eq.3 with XCOM1 =xM1 \u00d711.2, where xM1 and 11.2 \nrepresent the M1 mass fraction (see Table S2) in the corresponding SRM \ncatalyst and the CO conversion of the M1 catalyst alone at WHSV=5L. \nh-1.g-1, respectively). The XCOgain for the SRM arrangements (see Fig. 4a) \npresents, also, a volcano-type profile with a maximum located around \n50% of M2. \nIn order to validate the M1\u2013M2 proximity hypothesis (directly \nobserved with the LB arrangements), it is necessary to answer this \nquestion: \u2018what is the influence of the SRM catalyst composition on the \nM1-M2 proximity responsible for CO conversion? \u2019. \n3.3. Sphere contact quantification model in randomly packed binary \nmixtures for SRM arrangement \nTo investigate whether the volcano-curve profile of the XCOgain , for \nthe SRM arrangements, can be explained by the number of contacts \nbetween M1 and M2 as postulated, it is necessary to quantify it in a \nFig. 6.(a) FEG-SEM image, (b) Cu (red) and P (yellow) EDX mapping analysis of reduced SRM(0.50) catalyst, Cu (red) and P (yellow) EDX mapping of the surface of \n(c) M1 and (d) M2 grains and (e) schematic representation of the reduced SRM(0.50) catalyst.

Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n7dense packing of randomly distributed binary spheres (simplified rep-\nresentation of the SRM arrangement in Fig. 5a with rM1=rM2, it was also \nassumed that the grain size of M1 and M2 did not change during the \nreduction) as well as in mixtures of different compositions, according \nwith the methodology used in our previous study to determine the \nconcentration of number of contacts between two materials [12]. With \nthe statistical and geometric approach of the Dodds model [16,17] , it is \npossible to easily describe the texture of a 3D polydisperse random \nmixture. The Dodds model assumes that each particle constituting the \npolydisperse mixture is in contact with all its neighbors. This basic hy-\npothesis allows to divide the space into tetrahedral subunits ijkl (i, j, k \nand l representing the indices of the species constituting the four vertices \nof a tetrahedron), containing a part of vacuum and each vertex being the \ncenter of a given particle. A binary random mixture (composed of 2 \nfamilies of type 1 and 2 particles, representing M1 and M2, respectively \nfor this study) has 5 types of tetrahedral subunits (1111, 1112, 1122, \n1222, and 2222, Fig. 5b). These different tetrahedral subunits are \ngeometrically fully characterized with the angles a, b and c at the \nsummit i, the spherical angles \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 and the area AT of the spherical \ntriangle (ABC) [18]. The geometry of such a tetrahedral subunit is \ncompletely described by the radii of the four spheres forming it (ri, rj, rk \net rj). By knowing the particles radii and their distributions in number, it \nis possible to determine coordination numbers, porosity, and distribu -\ntion of the different contact types in the polydisperse mixture. In the \nspirit of the Dodds model, model calculations were performed. A \nmathematical model was developed in order to determine the concen -\ntration of number of contacts between M1\u2013M1, M2\u2013M2, and M1\u2013M2 \n(denoted [NC11], [NC22], and [NC12] and expressed in number of \ncontacts per gram of catalyst) for any composition of the SRM catalyst \n(see Fig. 5c, all the details of the proposed model are presented in the \nsupporting information in the section \u201cDescription of the contact \nmodel \u201d). \nIn order to have a representative view of the impact of the M1-M2 contacts in the XCOgain , we compared the evolution of the normalized \nconcentration of number of contacts between M1\u2013M2 with the \nnormalized XCOgain as a function of the M2 proportion in the catalyst \n(Fig. 5d). It clearly appears that the obtained volcano curve for the \nconcentration of number of contacts between M1 and M2 with a \nmaximum at 50% M2 is identical to the one obtained for the normalized \nXCOgain . This result validates the contact \u2013reactivity relationship \nhypothesis. \n3.4. Reduced SRM arrangement structure and morphology \nWe observed that the CO conversion is dramatically affected by the \nSRM catalyst composition, and therefore by the amount of M1-M2 \ncontacts present in the hybrid materials. We investigated the structure \nand textural parameters for the best CO conversion catalyst (SRM(0.50)) \nto understand the nature of M1-M2 contacts. The XRD diffractogram at \nthe fresh plotted in Fig. S6a is a linear combination of the M1 and M2 \nones. After reduction, it corresponds to a combination of the diffracto -\ngram of reduced M1 and to the one of SAPO-34 for which the peaks are \nslightly shifted to the low angles (Fig. S6b). This shift could be due to \ncationic exchange within the zeotype. [19,20] The morphology of the \nreduced SRM(0.50) catalyst obtained by FEG-SEM measurements is \npresented in Fig. 6 (see also Fig. S7 in supporting Information for the \ncomplete EDX mapping analysis). The reduced catalyst behaves like a \ndense packing of randomly distributed binary grains with grain sizes \nsimilar to those of the fresh hybrid catalyst (Fig. 6a), which agrees with \nthe starting point of our theoretical model (Fig. 5a). In order to differ -\nentiate the nature of each catalyst grain, a mapping of the main char-\nacteristic elements of M1 and M2 (Cu (in red) and P (in yellow), \nrespectively) was carried out (Fig. 6b). It can be seen that, after the \nreduction, this granular mixture includes not only conventional contacts \nbetween the grains of M1 and M2 (as one might expect), but also a \ndecoration of the surface of the grains of M1 by microcubes of M2 (see \nFig. 7.(a) NH3-TPD profiles of M1, M2, LB and SRM arrangements (m(M1+M2)=0.250 mg) and M1+M2 represents a linear combination of the corresponding M1 \nand M2 NH3-TPD profiles) and (b) NH3-TPD subtraction profiles.

A generic \nstructure for reduced SRM catalysts is schematically presented in Fig. 6e. \nThese grain decorations optimize the intimacy between M1 and M2 \n(M1/M2 interphase) which is promote the elimination of the restriction \nof methanol synthesis by the thermodynamic equilibrium shift and \ntherefore increase of the CO conversion. \n3.5. Characterization of the M1-M2 contacts \nThe quantity of interphases between M1 and M2 can be determined, \nindirectly, using the properties of a Cu exchanged SAPO-34 synthesis \nmethod, generally used for the selective catalytic reduction with \nammonia (NH 3-SCR) [19]. This method, named solid-state ion-exchange \n(SSIE), consists in mixing copper oxide with SAPO-34 and heating it at low temperature (T<250\u25e6C) under an atmosphere of NH3, which leads \nto the diffusion of metal ions in the zeolite [19]. The mobility of Cu is \nproposed to be related to the formation of complexes [Cu(I)(NH 3)x]+\n(x\u22652). Indeed, these linear complexes have a diameter similar to that of \nan NH3 molecule, thus allowing these species to easily penetrate into the \nporous system of the zeolite and thus to improve the Cu exchange. One \ncan thus easily imagine that if one carries out this method with our \nmaterials (LB and SRM arrangements), the mobility of Cu should in-\ncrease with the concentration of contact between M1 and M2. The use of \nNH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH 3-TPD) on our materials \nallows not only to perform the SSIE process during the NH3 adsorption \nstep, but also to indirectly quantify the amount of Cu exchanged in M2 \n(and therefore a representation of M1-M2 contact concentration). \nFig. 7a shows the NH3-TPD profiles on LB and SRM arrangements \n(the dimensions of our NH3-TPD reactor did not allow us to perform the \nmeasurements for the 8LB(7) and 10LB(9) arrangements). These profiles \nare characterized by three desorption peaks: a low temperature (LT) \npeak at ~200\u25e6C (assigned to NH3 adsorbed to Lewis acid sites [21\u201327]), \nan intermediate temperature (IT) peak at 250\u2013350\u25e6C (corresponding to \nNH3 adsorbed on Cu-sites [21\u201325] created on the zeolite because Cu2+\ncations could exchange with the H+in zeolites partially, introducing \nsome cations to the framework [28,29] ) and a high temperature (HT) \npeak (>400\u25e6C, attributed to NH3 adsorbed on Br\u00f8nsted acid sites i.e. \nformation of NH4+[20\u201324]). NH3-TPD of reduced SRM(0.50) followed \nby DRIFT spectroscopy (Fig. S8) confirmed the presence of Lewis acid \nsites (bands at 3385 \u20133335, 3275, 1622, 1274 and 1219 cm-1) and \nBr\u00f8nsted acid sites (3270, 1490 \u20131450 cm-1) as well as NH3 adsorbed on \nCu+sites on SAPO-34 (3184 cm-1). A detailed attribution is provided in \nthe supporting information . \nIn order to better understand the shape of the LB and SRM ar-\nrangements NH3-TPD profiles, measurements were carried out on \ndifferent masses of M1 and M2 alone. From these new profiles, it was \npossible to simulate theoretical NH3-TPD profiles, corresponding to \nmixtures of M1+M2 without contacts (M1+M2(x), where x represents \nthe M2 content), using linear combination from the characteristic M1 \nand M2 profiles to the masses of the different LB and SRM arrangements \nused. The theoretical profiles obtained are shown in Fig. 7a. \nWhen the M2 catalyst is associated with the M1 catalyst without \ncontact, it is observed that the experimental profile of 2LB(0) is an exact \ncopy of the profile of M1+M2(0.50) simulated profile (the total acidity \nmeasured for 2LB(0) of 1230 \u00b5molg-1 is in perfect agreement with the \nvalue calculated for M1+M2(0.50) of 1238 \u00b5molg-1). When both cat-\nalysts are in contact (2LB(1), 4LB(3), 6LB(5) and SRM arrangements), \nthe experimental profiles are no in agreement with the simulated pro-\nfiles. An increase in the intensity of the IT peak (corresponding to NH3 \nadsorbed at Cu-sites) and an increase in the total acidity are observed, \nindicating a change in behavior linked to the migration of Cu within the \nzeolite. \nFig. 7b shows the results of subtractions between experimental \nprofiles (for the 2LB(1), 4LB(3), 6LB(5) and SRM arrangements) with the \ncorresponding simulated profiles. We observe not only the presence of \nthe peak at intermediate temperature at 340\u25e6C (IT1) but also the \nappearance of a new peak close to 400\u25e6C (IT2). As demonstrated by \nChen et al. [30], species that contribute to the IT1 and IT2 peaks could \nbe the decomposition of the [Cu(I)(NH 3)2]+and [Cu(II)(OH)(NH 3)3]+\ncomplexes, respectively. In order to have a representative view of the \neffect of the contact between M1 and M2 over the Cu migration, the total \nconcentration of both peaks (IT1 and IT2) versus the number of contacts \nin LB arrangements and versus the M2 content in SRM arrangements are \nshown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. It clearly appears that the evolu -\ntions of the concentration of new peaks are identical to those obtained \nfor XCOgain of LB and SRM arrangements (in Figs. 3a and 4a). The evo-\nlution of XCOgain obtained with the LB and SRM arrangements scales \nlinearly with the concentrations of new peaks, with an interception to \nzero (see Fig. 8c). This result clearly evidences that the NH3-TPD mea-\nsurements can be used to quantify contacts between M1 and M2 for one \nFig. 8.(a) Evolution of the new NH3-TPD peaks concentrations versus the \nnumber of contacts in LB arrangements and (b) versus the M2 content in SRM \narrangements, (c) Evolution of the XCOgain of the LB and SRM arrangements \nversus the new NH3-TPD peaks concentration.

When the SAPO-34 catalyst was associated with the Cu-ZnO- \nAl2O3 catalyst (LB arrangement), without contact, CO conversion has \nnot changed compared to the test with the M1 catalyst alone. However, \nthe disappearance of methanol and DME was observed in favor of hy-\ndrocarbons (with a significant selectivity toward CH4 and CO2). When \nboth catalysts were in contact (LB arrangement), an increase of CO \nconversion and HC selectivity and a decrease of CH4 selectivity were \nobserved. This phenomenon is amplified with the increase of the contact \nconcentration. In order to improve the CO conversion, different SRM of \nCu-ZnO-Al 2O3 and SAPO-34 were made. The impact of the composition \nof the SRM hybrid catalyst was investigated and shown a volcano-like \nprofile for CO conversion as a function of M2 content in the catalyst. \nTo elucidate the effect of composition on CO conversion a mathematical \nmodel for Cu-ZnO-Al 2O3 and SAPO-34 contact quantification, based on a \ngeometrical and statistical approach allowing the textural description of \na random polydisperse medium, was developed. The experimental re-\nsults were compared with theoretical calculations. A direct correlation \nwas found between theory and experiment. The density of contact be-\ntween Cu-ZnO-Al 2O3 and SAPO-34 was identified as the key factor for \nthe catalytic performances (contact-activity relationships). Finally, the \nknowledge of the contact morphology, determined by FEG-SEM, \nallowed proposing the NH3-TPD as the concentration of contact char-\nacterization method. \nDeclaration of Competing Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial \ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence \nthe work reported in this paper. \nAcknowledgments \nThe French National Research agency \u201cAgence Nationale de la \nRecherche \u201d (ANR) is acknowledged for the financial support of the INCH \nproject (ANR-17-CE07 \u20130011). \nAppendix A.Supporting information \nSupplementary data associated with this article can be found in the \nonline version at doi:10.1016/j.apcata.2022.118757 . \nReferences \n[1]M.

In the past few decades, there has\nbeen growing scienti\ufb01c consensus to devise the strategy for CO 2\ncapture, \ufb01xation, and recycling technologies to level off the atmo-spheric CO\n2concentration. Nature has its own CO 2\ufb01xation process\nwhich is extraordinarily selective in converting CO 2into organic\ncompounds. However, natural chemical transformation of CO 2is\nnot simply fast enough to cope with the increasing CO 2emission\nrate of the industrialized world. Chemical transformation of CO 2\nis not only about mitigating the global warming; rather it is aboutrecycling of the carbon, irreversibly relocated in the form of CO\n2\nfrom the ground by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natu-\nral gas. In the light of the \ufb01nite availability of fossil fuels, the pro-\nduction of commercially valuable chemicals and fuels from CO 2is a\npromising strategy to simultaneously tackle the two major prob-\nlems of the century, namely the global warming and fossil fuel\ndepletion, for sustainable development. Among others, heteroge-\nneous catalytic hydrogenation of CO 2bears a strong potential totreat large amount of CO 2in a short time, rendering it an important\nmean for CO 2conversion.\nMethanol (MeOH) can be synthesized from CO 2hydrogenation\nand is one of the most celebrated and widely suggested alterna-\ntives for chemical energy carrier [1,2] . It is an excellent fuel and\na key starting material of the important industrial reactions. The\nuse of methanol in fuel cells directly or indirectly as the source\nof hydrogen by a reforming reaction is well documented. Actively\ninvestigated hydrogen production by photocatalytic or electrocat-\nalytic water splitting powered by renewable (e.g. solar and wind)\nenergies can be regarded as future sources of hydrogen for CO 2\nhydrogenation [3,4] . In addition, fundamental chemical products\nlike ole\ufb01ns can be produced via a methanol-to-ole\ufb01n (MTO) pro-\ncess [5]and various organic compounds like dimethyl ether\n(DME), that is, a potential substitute of diesel oil for its better com-bustion performance [6], can be produced from methanol. The\ncommercially practiced processes of methanol synthesis from CO\nand CO\n2are operated at relatively low one-pass conversions and\nrequire separation and/or recycling of unconverted reactants to\nattain high conversions. Currently, the commercial methanol\nsynthesis processes are operated typically at about 50\u2013100 bar\nusing copper- and zinc-based catalysts [7]. Lowering the reaction\npressure is generally favoured because of the general perception\nof increased energy demands at high-pressure operation.

Besides, high-pressure approaches can\nfacilitate the reduction in reactor volume when reactants and/or\nproducts are compressive, reducing the plant area which conse-\nquently reduces capital costs, and possible improvements in han-\ndling dangerous chemicals such as hydrogen more safely when\nused in a small volume. Above all, such approaches may result in\nshifting equilibrium conversion and in the formation of unique\nphase and states of reaction mixture and catalysts, thus boosting\ncatalytic activity.\nThe \ufb01rst high-pressure methanol synthesis process was com-\nmercialized by BASF in 1923, operated at pressure of 250\u2013\n350 bar with a mixture of syngas with CO 2as reactants [9]. The\nuse of high pressure was necessary due to thermodynamics; de-\ncrease in temperature and increase in reaction pressure should fa-\nvour the methanol formation. As mentioned above, modern\nprocesses are operated at lower reaction pressures of ca. 50\u2013\n100 bar at comparably lower temperatures thanks to the highly ac-\ntive Cu\u2013Zn-based catalysts [10]. Related to CO 2hydrogenation,\nIpatieff and Monroe reported high-pressure study up to 412 bar\nover Cu/Al 2O3catalysts in a \ufb01xed bed reactor, which showed\nremarkable selectivity to methanol and high conversion of CO 2\n[11]. However, in their study, the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV),\nindicative of the productivity of the reaction, was very low (ca.\n1000 h/C01) to make the process practically viable.\nHerein, we report high-pressure (up to 360 bar) CO 2hydrogena-\ntion to methanol over co-precipitated Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3catalysts at\nhigh GHSV (>10,000 h/C01). Under speci\ufb01c reaction conditions with\nconventional methanol synthesis catalysts, we will show that one\ncan achieve close-to-full one-pass conversion of CO 2to methanol.\nFurthermore, DME and hydrocarbons production from methanol\ncan be directly incorporated or combined with the methanol syn-\nthesis process, outlining the high \ufb02exibility and versatility of the\nreported CO 2hydrogenation process.\n2. Experimental\n2.1. Materials\nCopper nitrate hexahydrate ( P98%, Alfa Aesar), zinc nitrate\nhexahydrate (98%, Sigma\u2013Aldrich), aluminium nitrate nonahydrate\n(P98%, Fluka), potassium hydroxide ( P85%, Sigma\u2013Aldrich), c-\nAl2O3(Bimodal, Alfa Aesar) and NH 4-ZSM-5 (SiO 2/Al2O3= 50/1, Alfa\nAesar) were used as received. Deionized water was used for cata-\nlyst synthesis. A commercial methanol synthesis catalyst was pur-\nchased from Alfa Aesar (Product ID: 45776). Liquid CO 2\n(>99.9993%) and 10% Ar in H 2(>99.999% for Ar or H 2, prior to mix-\ning) were purchased from Linde.\n2.2. Catalyst synthesis\nFor the synthesis of Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3, aqueous solutions of copper\nnitrate hexahydrate (0.2 M), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.2 M) and\naluminium nitrate nonahydrate (0.2 M) with potassium hydroxide\n(0.5 M) were slowly added together, in a round-bottom \ufb02ask to\nprecipitate the corresponding hydroxides. During the precipitation,\nthe round-bottom \ufb02ask was heated at 80 /C176C under constant stir-\nring, and the pH of the solution with precipitate was maintained\nbetween 9.5 and 10.5. The precipitate was aged for 48 h, \ufb01ltered\nand washed with water until the pH of the washed solution\nreached the value of 7.5. Then, the sample was dried at 100 /C176C\novernight, crushed and calcined in air at 400 /C176C for 4 h to yield\nCu/ZnO/Al 2O3(I). Following the same synthesis procedure, twomore catalysts, Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(II) and Cu/Al 2O3, were prepared\nusing different compositions of precursor solutions. H-ZSM-5 was\nprepared by calcination of NH 4-ZSM-5 in air at 400 /C176C for 4 h. An-\nother Cu/Al 2O3(18/82 wt%) catalyst was prepared by the incipient\nwetness impregnation method. The preparation method and cata-\nlyst properties are described elsewhere [12]. Prior to charging the\ncatalysts into reactor, they were pelletized, crushed and sieved a\nsize of 100\u2013300 lm. Elemental composition, Cu surface area, CuO\ncrystallite size and BET surface area of the synthesized and com-\nmercial catalysts are listed in Table S1 (Supplementary material ).\n2.3. Catalytic testing\nCO2hydrogenation reaction was performed in the microreac-\ntion set-up and tubular reactors (ID: 1.74 mm, OD: 3.17 mm) were\nused throughout. Details of the set-up and method of product anal-\nysis are described elsewhere [12]. For methanol synthesis, 170 mg\nof Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(I) was used. In the study of very low to high\nGHSVs using the commercial catalyst, 1000, 85 or 42.5 mg of the\ncatalyst was used for the catalytic tests in the range of 425,\n10,000\u201340,000 or 81,000\u2013182,000 h/C01, respectively.\nFor the synthesis of DME, H-ZSM-5 (150 mg) was mixed with\nCu/ZnO/Al 2O3(II) (170 mg) and charged into one reactor or the\ntwo catalysts were charged separately into two reactors connected\nin series.\nFor hydrocarbon synthesis, H-ZSM-5 (170 mg) was charged into\na reactor connected in series after that containing Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3\n(II) for methanol synthesis. The temperature of the secondary reac-tor containing H-ZSM-5 was controlled independently from the\n\ufb01rst one. For alkane synthesis, the reactor with H-ZSM-5 wasplaced before the back pressure regulator, thus kept at the same\npressure as the \ufb01rst one ( Fig. S8 ). While in alkene synthesis, the\nsecondary reactor was located after the back pressure regulator\n(Fig. S9 ) and kept at the atmospheric pressure. It should be noted\nthat GHSVs for the combined processes (DME and hydrocarbon\nsyntheses) were calculated based on the amount of the methanol\nsynthesis catalyst in the reactor.\nFor the above three reactions, argon was used as an internal\nstandard for gas chromatography (GC) analysis and product selec-\ntivity was calculated taking only carbon-containing products into\naccount.\n3.

Reaction conditions: T= 260 /C176C, P= 360 bar,\nGHSV = 10,471 h/C01.A. Bansode, A. Urakawa / Journal of Catalysis 309 (2014) 66\u201370 67at 260 /C176C, 360 bar, and GHSV of 10,471 h/C01. At the conventional\nCO2/H2molar ratio of 1:3 de\ufb01ned by the stoichiometry of CO 2\nhydrogenation to methanol, CO 2conversion was 37% with 72%\nmethanol selectivity. Drastic rise in both values was observed\nwhen H 2partial pressure was further increased to CO 2/H2= 1:10.\nAt this ratio, CO 2conversion was outstanding (95%) with high\nmethanol selectivity (98%), suppressing CO formation to a negligi-\nble extent. Under this condition, the methanol weight time yield\n(WTY) was found to be 1 :2gMeOH g/C01\ncath/C01.\nTheoretical equilibrium conversion values for CO 2and H 2at\nvarious CO 2/H2ratios under this reaction condition ( Supplemen-\ntary material, Fig. S1 ) show interesting insights of the catalytic per-\nformance. It is worth highlighting that the equilibrium conversion\nis very high (>94%) even when the mixture is at the stoichiometric\nratio (CO 2/H2= 1:3, Fig. S1 ) under the high-pressure condition.\nExperimentally at CO 2/H2= 1:<10, the conversion values are far\nfrom the equilibrium values, while at 1: P10 the values are almost\nidentical to those expected from the equilibrium ( Fig. 1 vs.S1). The\nWTYs were smaller at the high H 2partial pressures due to lower\nCO2mass \ufb02ow at the constant GHSV ( Table S2 ). The results indicate\nthat at the feed ratio of 1: P10, the process operates in the thermo-\ndynamic regime reaching the equilibrium CO 2conversion and\nmethanol selectivity under the investigated condition, whereas at\nthe feed ratio of 1:<10, the reaction falls into the kinetic regime.\nJudging from the similar theoretical equilibrium conversion at\nthe different CO 2/H2ratios, the experimentally observed outstand-\ning CO 2conversion and methanol selectivity at high H 2partial\npressure (i.e. CO 2/H2=1 :P10) are most likely due to the rate accel-\neration for methanol formation by the high H 2partial pressure. Be-\nsides, the H 2conversion was observed to be decreasing with the\nincrease in H 2partial pressure, as expected from the excess of H 2\nrelative to CO 2. However, it should be noted that the energy ef\ufb01-\nciency towards methanol formation was greatly enhanced at\nCO2/H2=1 :P10 because of the suppressed, competitive reverse\nwater\u2013gas shift (RWGS; CO 2+H 2?CO + H 2O) reaction. The H 2\nconsumption rate at conventional feed ratio of 1:3 was found to\nbe 88 mmol g/C01\ncath/C01towards methanol and 11 mmol g/C01\ncath/C01to-\nwards CO formation, whereas at 1:10, it was 110 mmol g/C01\ncath/C01\nand almost exclusively used for the production of methanol. This\nis an important fact in practice because at high H 2partial pressure\nthe energy (incl. hydrogen molecules as chemical energy) and time\n(thus for better yield) required for methanol production are mini-\nmized and solely used for methanol synthesis. Also, we demon-\nstrated the documented analogies of high-pressure advantages\nbetween methanol synthesis and classic Haber\u2013Bosch ammonia\nsynthesis processes by achieving the equilibrium yield [13].Fig. 2 depicts the effects of temperature on the catalytic perfor-\nmance at 360 bar, CO 2/H2= 1:10, and GHSV of 10,471 h/C01. A rise in\ntemperature greatly enhanced CO 2conversion, reaching the maxi-\nmum at 260 /C176C with the aforementioned outstanding methanol\nproductivity. Further rise in temperature resulted in methanol\nselectivity decrease and in apparent compensating increase in CO\nformation. At a lower pressure of 200 bar, a similar trend with a\nmaximum in the catalytic performance at 280 /C176C was observed\n(XCO2= 79%, S MeOH = 88%, Fig. S4 ). This great enhancement in meth-\nanol selectivity upon temperature increase is surprising at \ufb01rst\nglance because the competitive RWGS reaction is an endothermic\nreaction and higher temperature should facilitate the reaction with\nrespect to methanol synthesis that is an exothermic reaction and\npreferable at lower temperature [10,14] .\nComparing the obtained results to the thermodynamic calcula-\ntions ( Figs. S2 and S3 ), above 260 /C176C the reaction reaches close to\nthe equilibrium conversion, hence falling into thermodynamic re-\ngime. This thermodynamic control can be clearly con\ufb01rmed by\nreproduction of the trend for the unexpected decrease in CO 2con-\nversion above 260 /C176C, accompanying decrease in methanol selec-\ntivity ( Fig. 2 vs.S2 and S3 ). On the other hand, below 260 /C176C the\nCO2conversion was far from equilibrium and the enhanced meth-\nanol selectivity towards higher temperature up to 260 /C176C can be re-\ngarded due to the kinetic control. When the reaction is kinetically\ncontrolled, the high selectivity to CO is more pronounced ( Fig. 2 )a s\nobserved for the aforementioned kinetically controlled regime\n(Fig. 1 )a tC O 2/H2= 1:<10. This observation suggests that the CO 2\nhydrogenation to methanol proceeds via CO.\nIt is intriguing to notice that with the Cu/Al 2O3catalyst pre-\npared by the impregnation route, the formation of products was\nobserved to be in accordance with the thermodynamic principles,\ni.e. better methanol selectivity at lower temperatures and higher\nCO selectivity and higher CO 2conversion at higher temperatures,\nbut with overall poor catalytic performance very far from the equi-\nlibrium ( Table S3 ). There may be some differences in the nature of\nactive sites of the catalysts prepared by the impregnation and co-\nprecipitation routes. Also, the boosting in catalytic performance\nwith a maximum at a speci\ufb01c temperature was not observed with\nthe Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3catalyst at the conventional CO 2/H2ratio of 1:3\n(Fig. S5 ). The absence of the maximum is likely due to the kinetic\ncontrol by the poorer catalytic performance at the lower H 2partial\npressure as evidenced by the higher CO selectivity ( Fig. S5 ).\nIpatieff and Monroe reported that under high-pressure condi-\ntions, CO 2is \ufb01rst reduced to CO via the RWGS reaction accompany-\ning the formation of water, and subsequently to formaldehyde as a\nsecondary reaction. The formed formaldehyde was suggested to be\nfurther reduced to methanol via two pathways: one via direct\nhydrogenation and the other via Cannizzaro reaction [11].I ti s\nwidely accepted that methanol is directly formed from CO 2rather\nthan CO [15\u201317] ; however, this may be applicable to reactions at\nlow or moderate pressures. In context with such high pressure\nand with obtained high conversions, the pathway for methanol for-\nmation via CO, suggested by Ipatieff and Monroe, is indeed in\naccordance with our observation. The high selectivity to CO at low-\ner temperatures can be explained by the slow secondary reaction\nof CO towards the formation of methanol. Likely, this secondary\nreaction is accelerated by increasing temperature, particularly at\nhigh pressure, and also the amount of methanol is greatly en-\nhanced due to the increased amount of CO produced by the endo-\nthermic RWGS reaction.\nIn addition, the formed water may promote CO hydrogenation\nas reported in literature [18]. As mentioned previously without\nmechanistic studies or operando observation of active sites and\nspecies, which is out of scope of the current investigation, this\nstudy points that CO 2hydrogenation to methanol proceeds via\nCO formation under high-pressure conditions.

Effect of temperature on CO 2conversion (X CO2), H 2conversion (X H2) and\nselectivity to CO (S CO) and methanol (S MeOH ) over the Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(I) catalyst.\nReaction conditions: P= 360 bar, GHSV = 10,471 h/C01,C O 2/H2= 1:10.68 A. Bansode, A. Urakawa / Journal of Catalysis 309 (2014) 66\u201370by Bennekom et al. on methanol synthesis from CO-rich or CO 2-\nrich syngas showed that >90% CO 2conversion and high selectivity\nto methanol could be achieved at speci\ufb01c conditions (e.g. 200 bar\nand 210 /C176C) due to phase separation of products (methanol and\nwater) by condensation, thus unlimiting the one-phase equilib-\nrium conversion [19]. One possible explanation of the high cata-\nlytic performance of this work may also be due to a similar\nphase separation; however, the study by Bennekom et al. showed\nmarked lowering of CO 2conversion in the temperature range re-\nported to be optimal from this work and thus only phase behaviour\ncannot explain the high catalytic performance and rather thermo-\ndynamics and rate enhancement at high H 2pressure more likely\nplay decisive roles under the conditions of this work.\nFor Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(I), methanol selectivity against CO selectivity\nwas the best at 10,471 h/C01, compared to a lower (5000 h/C01) and a\nhigher (20,000 h/C01) GHSVs ( Table S5 ). The results at 5000 h/C01may\nbe due to a side reaction started to be operative at the very long\ncontact time of the product (methanol) with the catalyst, as evi-\ndenced by the higher production of DME. At the increased GHSV\nof 20,000 h/C01, the WTY for methanol was found to be\n1:99 gMeOH g/C01\ncath/C01, proving that the investigated process is able\nto maintain high methanol productivity while retaining higher le-vel of conversion and methanol selectivity under at increased\nGHSV conditions.\nMoreover, the commercial methanol synthesis catalyst was also\ntested under similar reaction conditions. Excellent catalytic perfor-\nmance similar to that shown in Figs. 1 and 2 was con\ufb01rmed. The\ncatalyst was highly productive in methanol synthesis and WTY of\n7:7gMeOH was obtained at a very high GHSV of 182,000 h/C01\n(Table S6 ) with 65.8% CO 2conversion and 77.3% methanol selectiv-\nity. This WTY is superior to any values reported to date for one-\npass yield of methanol via CO 2hydrogenation, con\ufb01rming the gen-\neral applicability and practical relevance of the \ufb01nding. Increased\nCO selectivity at higher GHSVs again suggests the previously dis-\ncussed reaction pathway to produce methanol via CO. The sidereaction observed for Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(I) also took place over the\ncommercial catalyst at the very low GHSV of 425 h/C01, in this case\ntowards methane formation ( Table S6 ). These results point out that\nthere is an optimal GHSV for methanol productivity and selectivity\nin practice.\nFurthermore, with the optimal conditions of CO 2/H2ratio, pres-\nsure and space velocity, we examined the performance of the co-\nprecipitated Cu/Al 2O3catalyst without the Zn component. Good le-\nvel of CO 2conversion (82%) with high methanol selectivity (92%)\nwas obtained at 280 /C176C(Fig. S6 ). This observation reveals that the\noutstanding catalytic performance is related mainly to the high\npressure, to the feed composition and also to the synthesis method\nof the catalyst, thus to the speci\ufb01c state of Cu in the catalysts pre-\npared by the co-precipitation route [20]. The promoting effect of\nCu\u2013Zn combination is recognized but subtly pronounced underthe high-pressure condition of this work. Moreover, the catalytic\nperformance of Cu/ZnO/Al\n2O3was stable under the optimal condi-\ntion or under varying conditions of the CO 2/H2feed ratio for 128 h\n(Table S4 ).\nThe use of bi-functional catalysts for one-step DME production\nfrom CO 2is widely known [2,21] , and solid acid catalysts such as c-\nalumina, H-ZSM-5 and Na-H-ZSM-5 have been used in combina-\ntion with methanol synthesis catalysts to add the secondary func-\ntion [22]. Stimulated by the results obtained for methanol\nsynthesis, we evaluated one-step conversion of CO 2into DME via\nin situ conversion of methanol using physically mixed pre-pellet-\nized Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(II) and H-ZSM-5 catalysts ( Fig. 3 ). To our great\npositive surprise, the reaction conditions productive and selective\nfor methanol synthesis were also suited for one-step DME synthe-\nsis. Despite the presence of H-ZSM-5 catalyst in a physically mixed\nstate, the catalytic system exhibited similar levels of CO 2conver-\nsion as in methanol synthesis. DME selectivity remained always\nabove 80% starting from the lowest examined temperature and\nwas the highest (89%) at 300 /C176C, retaining or even slightly boosting\nCO2conversion (97% at 280 /C176C). At 280 and 300 /C176C, the rest prod-\nucts were mainly methanol with traces of CO (<0.3%). This reaction\ncan also be operated by separating two catalysts into respective\nreactors connected in series and a similar performance as with\nthe physically mixed bed could be achieved ( Fig. S7 ).\nFinally, we conducted experiment towards the synthesis of al-\nkanes and alkenes from the obtained methanol using the same cat-\nalysts without any puri\ufb01cation step by changing reactor\ncon\ufb01gurations. First, we placed the Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(II) and H-ZSM-\n5 catalysts in series in respective tubular reactors maintained at\ndifferent temperatures at the same pressure ( Fig. S8 ).Table 1 ,\nexperiment no. 1 illustrates the CO 2conversion and product distri-\nbution when the reactor packed with Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3(II) was kept at\n260/C176C while that of H-ZSM-5 was kept at 375 /C176C, 360 bar. The\ndominant products were hydrocarbons ranging from C 1to C 4, i.e.\nethane (20%), propane (24%) and isobutane (26%). The overall\nhydrocarbon selectivity was found to be 85%. The hydrogenation\nactivity towards alkanes was apparently enhanced under the pres-\nsurized conditions since the ef\ufb02uent of methanol synthesis reactor\nwas H 2-rich.

Conclusion\nThe catalytic system described in this work provides an ef\ufb01cient\nand highly productive processing strategy for CO 2conversion at a\nsingle step. The high-pressure approach using a conventional Cu/\nZnO/Al 2O3methanol synthesis catalyst under speci\ufb01c reaction con-\nditions for CO 2hydrogenation remarkably boosted methanol selec-\ntivity and productivity by (i) the high H 2partial pressure to\nenhance the reaction rate and (ii) thermodynamically favoured\nhigh CO 2conversion and methanol selectivity at high pressure.\nThe preliminary experiments with the commercial catalyst showed\nextraordinary high methanol productivity at very high GHSVs, pos-\nsibly justifying the capital and manufacturing costs of high-pres-\nsure processes. Negligible pressure drops under the examined\nGHSVs are the advantage of compressive reactants at high pres-\nsure. The consumed hydrogen was exclusively utilized for metha-\nnol formation at increased hydrogen partial pressure, thereby\nincreasing the ef\ufb01ciency of the process towards methanol synthe-\nsis by suppressing chemical and thermal energy consumption for\nRWGS reaction. Moreover, the excess of hydrogen remaining instream present under the optimal reaction condition reported in\nthis work can be fed directly to another identical or multiples of\nhigh-pressure reactors with possible reduction in their sizes, so\nthat compression of hydrogen may only require at initial stage\nwhereas methanol productivity would be multiples of connected\nreactors. In such con\ufb01gurations, the recycling of H\n2can be mini-\nmized or potentially omitted.\nOne-step transformation of CO 2to DME by the co-presence of\nthe H-ZSM-5 catalyst showed remarkable ability of this process\nwithout lowering the CO 2conversion level. Also, the methanol-,\nwater- and H 2-rich stream can be directly fed to the reactor con-\ntaining the H-ZSM-5 catalyst and good selectivity to alkane or al-\nkene was attained, instigating further development of CO 2to\nole\ufb01ns and/or gasoline processes via one-step hydrogenation. The\nCO2transformation approach presented in this study may allowthe convenient operation of small scale yet highly productive\nplants for CO 2hydrogenation at sites where CO 2is captured and\nstored.\nAcknowledgments\nFinancial support from the ICIQ foundation and MINECO\n(CTQ2012-34153) is greatly acknowledged.

Methanol, the simplest of\nalcohols, is found in nature in small amounts including interstellar space and nature on earth, where it is produced by anaerobe metabo-\nlism. Humans made methanol by pyrolysis or destructive distillation of wood for hundreds and even thousands of years before the last\ncentury where it became an industrial commodity and it is now produced in more than 13 l/year for each person on earth. The installed\nproduction capacity of methanol is around 110 million tons per year (MTY) [1], while the demand for methanol was approximately 80\u201390\nmillion tons in 2018. The requirement for methanol in 2023 is forecasted to exceed 110 MTY and is expected to outgrow the production\ncapacity. Today, methanol is manufactured from fossil fuels, but methanol can also be made from renewable energy resources. Methanol\nhas for that reason been suggested as the base molecule in a methanol economy as opposed to a hydrogen economy [2]and in this way\nmethanol may support the development of energy solutions with reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe applications of methanol are very diversi\ufb01ed: It is used to make a large series of chemical products including formaldehyde,\ndimethyl ether (DME), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME), acetic acid, dimethyl terephthalate, methyl chloride,\nand ole\ufb01ns via the methanol to ole\ufb01ns/propene (MTO/MTP) process. These chemicals are subsequently applied to make a wide range of\neveryday products including fuel additives, resins, plastics, paints, polyester, and building materials. Methanol is also used as a clean burn-\ning biodegradable fuel for vehicles, mainly for fuel blending, and to make high octane gasoline by the methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) or TIGAS\n(Topsoe Improved Gasoline Synthesis) processes. It is proposed as an alternative low sulfur marine fuel with low particulate emissions in\nnear coastal areas from 2020, when the MARPOL legislation becomes effective. There is currently a strong growth in the demand for metha-nol of approximately 6% per year, mainly driven by an increasing demand for ole\ufb01ns made by MTO/MTP and fuel blending especially in\nChina.\n2. Methanol synthesis technology\nThe technology for methanol production is well established (see Fig. 1 ) and improvements of both the synthesis technology and the\ncatalyst have for many years been incremental. The main raw materials for manufacture of methanol are natural gas and coal, but gasi\ufb01-\ncation of waste or biomass or the use of CO\n2and H 2O (to prepare H 2by electrolysis) may gain importance in the next couple of decades,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.002\n0021-9517/ /C2112019 Elsevier Inc.

Synthesis gas consists of CO, CO 2, and H 2, and considering the stoichiom-\netry for making methanol, the ideal module (M methanol ) for producing methanol should be close to two:\nMmethanol \u00bcH2/C0CO2\nCO\u00feCO2/C252\nFormation of methanol from synthesis gas proceeds via reactions (1)\u2013(3) and is exothermic and therefore cooling is needed, either by (i)\nboiling water or gas in cooled reactors or by interstage cooling between a series of adiabatic reactors using (ii) heat exchangers or (iii) addi-\ntion of quench gas. The equilibrium conversion that can be obtained in a single pass over the reactor depends on temperatures and pres-\nsures as depicted in Fig. 2 . The effective overall conversion of CO and CO 2in the synthesis gas to methanol is close to 100% due to the gas\nrecycle.\nCO\u00fe2H2\u00a2CH 3OHDH0\nR\u00bc/C089 kJ mol/C01\u00f01\u00de\nCO2\u00fe3H3\u00a2CH 3OH\u00feH2ODH0\nR\u00bc/C048 kJ mol/C01\u00f02\u00de\nCO\u00feH2O\u00a2CO2\u00feH2DH0\nR\u00bc/C041 kJ mol/C01\u00f03\u00de\nEven though industrial methanol synthesis catalysts are highly selective, selectivity is an issue especially for adiabatic reactors with\nethanol as the largest byproduct [3]. The formation of minor amounts of the byproducts acetone and methyl ethyl ketone is unwanted\nbecause they are dif\ufb01cult to remove by distillation.\nThe technology suppliers strive to make cheaper and more ef\ufb01cient methanol plants. The reforming or gasi\ufb01cation sections are crucial in\nthis work because these sections represent the main part of the construction and operation costs. One path to improve the ef\ufb01ciency of\nindustrial plants is to increase size and take advantage of the economy of scale and there is indeed a trend for building new highly ef\ufb01cient\nworld-class methanol plants with production capacities of up to 10.000 tons per day in areas with cheap feedstocks, mainly natural gas [3].\nLarge scale plants are predicted to be in service for decades, where the importance of CO 2reductions and minimization of the water con-\nsumption are expected to grow through customer requests and systems such as the EU emission trading scheme (ETS) and anti-\ufb02aring leg-\nislations. Future demands will therefore not only be the classic operation ef\ufb01ciency, but also the ability to use CO 2waste streams, CO 2\nrecovery or sequestration, increased use of renewable electricity or other steps that reduce climate and ecological footprints.\nMethanol may play an important role in a CO 2neutral future by assisting with the implementation of the goals in the Paris Climate\nAgreement. A high energy density energy carrier is most probably needed for some applications such as aviation, where energy densities\nof batteries are too low. Methanol has a reasonably high energy density of 15.6 MJ/l compared with 24 MJ/l for ethanol and 33 MJ/l for\ngasoline and can be produced from synthesis gas derived from gasi\ufb01cation of biomass or biomass fermentation to methane followed byRef or m in g\nPR/ SR/ ATR\nGasificationPreparation of\nsynt hesis gas Syn t h esis\ntec hnolog iesDistillation\ntec hnolog ies\nBoiling water\nreactorSi n gl e\ncolumn\n2 columns \n3 columnsNatural- & \nCoking gas\nEl ect r o l ysi sAdiabatic\nreactors\nGrade\nAAFu el\ngrade\nMT O \nGradeCoal &\nPet coke\nCO2&\nH2OS olid waste/biomassFeedst ock Methanol \npurity\nGas cooled \nreactor\nFig. 1.

Methanol is readily prepared from CO 2waste streams or in the future even CO 2extraction from air, when combined with\nhydrogen prepared by electrolysis of water using electricity from renewable resources such as solar, wind, or hydroelectric energy. One of\nthe main challenges when preparing electricity from solar panels or wind mills is the \ufb02uctuating nature of these energy sources. Prepara-\ntion of hydrogen by electrolysis of water and conversion into methanol is one answer to this challenge. Nevertheless, methanol prepared by\nthis technology is at present considerably more expensive than methanol made from fossil resources and also strongly dependent on the\nprice of renewable electricity.\nInterestingly, the demand for lowering CO 2emissions and anti-\ufb02aring regulations support another trend in the methanol market,\nnamely the desire to build small-scale plants near the end-user, using local (renewable) resources or small \ufb01elds of associated gas, which\nalso imply shorter transport of the methanol product. It is dif\ufb01cult for this market segment to really take off unless there is a pressure from\ngovernments to avoid \ufb02aring or/and reduce CO 2emissions. An opportunity for this technology could be mass production of small methanol\nplants through modulization and process simpli\ufb01cations that will bring the price of the decentralized methanol production down, even\nthough competition with modern large-scale plants bene\ufb01tting from current low gas prices seems unrealistic without an active taxation\nor regulation policy. The trend towards small plants may compel the synthesis to change as high pressures, large recycle streams, and com-\nplex feed and product puri\ufb01cation are expensive unit operations, where cost reductions and process integrations and simpli\ufb01cations are\nneeded.\n3. Interplay between methanol catalyst and technology\nIndustrial methanol synthesis catalysts applied today operate at 200\u2013300 /C176C and 50\u2013100 bar total pressure and consist of Cu as the\nactive metal, Al 2O3and ZnO to disperse Cu nano-particles and ZnO to assist Cu in making methanol (promotor). A series of additional pro-\nmotors such as Cr, Mg, Ca, Si, and Zr are often applied. This type of catalyst formulation was originally invented by ICI in the 1960s and has\nundergone important, but incremental improvements over the last \ufb01ve decades, and we are so far stuck with the advantages and disad-\nvantages of this chemical system.\nFrom an industrial point of view, methanol catalysts should ful\ufb01ll several requirements: The ideal methanol catalyst should have low\npressure drop and only moderate diffusion restrictions by choosing the right pellet size and shape, a high pellet strength to ensure mechan-\nical stability during loading and operation and it should also be possible to produce industrially in hundreds of tons with reasonable cost\nand ecological footprint. These requirements are challenges that are mainly addressed by industry today, but new potential catalysts devel-\noped by academia must eventually ful\ufb01ll the above requirements. The perfect methanol catalyst should also have decent activity and selec-\ntivity, high thermal stability, and good resistance towards poisons such as sulfur, chlorine, nickel/iron carbonyls, etc. These are all\nimportant scienti\ufb01c challenges to academia and subjects where new fundamental understanding may impact industrial practice. Activities\nof methanol synthesis catalysts and understanding of reaction mechanisms and promotor effects have received the majority of the atten-\ntion in the scienti\ufb01c literature. Selectivity, poisoning, and thermal stability of methanol synthesis catalysts are less discussed even though\nthere are excellent articles on these subjects [4\u201310] . Academia could provide more understanding of the mechanisms of poisoning (resis-\ntant) processes, catalyst stability, and synthesis of byproducts.\nThe developments towards large-scale plants, more CO 2rich feeds, waste gas streams, small-scale plants, and variable feed availability,\nbring new challenges to the scienti\ufb01c and industrial communities. One or more of the synthesis gas components in plants making use of\nrenewable feedstocks like CO 2waste streams and electrolysis are in general supplied at low pressure, and the cost of pressurizing to stan-\ndard synthesis pressures of 50\u2013100 bar is high. There is a wish to make methanol at lower pressures than today and thereby reduce both\ninvestment and operational costs, but this will come at a price of lower equilibrium conversions of the synthesis gas in a single pass of the\nreactor as depicted in Fig. 2 . One of the strongest desires in the methanol industry is development of methanol synthesis catalysts (and\nprocesses) that are able to operate at conditions where the conversion per pass of the methanol reactor is signi\ufb01cantly higher or even\nto make a once-through methanol synthesis process. It is possible to increase the conversion of one reactor pass by decreasing the tem-\nperature, but diminishing reaction rates over the present methanol catalysts at low temperatures now limit the temperatures to approx-\nimately /C21200/C176C. Making methanol catalysts more active at low temperatures could be an important improvement especially in small\nplants as lower pressures may reduce the price of the compression section considerably. Yet, the progress made so far has been limited.\nThis is most certainly due to interdependencies of the changes in thermodynamic properties of metals that are best illustrated by the\nso-called scaling relations where adsorption energies and reaction barriers scale simultaneously with fundamental descriptors such as oxy-\ngen and carbon adsorption energies [11]. Breaking these relations, for example, by using oxides/carbides or nitrides instead of metals is a\nmajor challenge to science, but also a direction to possible improvements in a heavily-explored scienti\ufb01c \ufb01eld.\nThe dream of nearly full conversion in a single reactor pass may also be obtained by breaking the thermodynamic limitations of the gas\nphase equilibrium for making methanol using a condensing methanol reactor. CO xand H 2are converted to condensing methanol in this\ntype of reactor, thereby eliminating methanol from the gas phase. The process is not commercial yet, although >95% conversion can be\nobtained in a single pass, but this approach holds an interesting perspective [12].\nCatalysts with higher capacities towards poisons or even catalysts tolerating poisons such as sulfur [10] would be highly interesting.\nSuch improvements would allow us to mitigate current challenges with poisons, handle new poisons, simplify and reduce cost of\n(small-scale) plants, and thus help us making methanol more ef\ufb01ciently. Today, typical impurities like sulfur, nickel, and iron are generally\nhandled in the puri\ufb01cation section with hydrogenation catalysts and absorbents as well as by avoiding metal dusting and making sure that\nthe plant is clean before start-up. Nevertheless, the production of many plants is still in\ufb02uenced by in principle preventable poisoning, so\nef\ufb01cient handling of this issue is still important. Applications of alternative gas feeds with impurities that are not normally encountered in\nconventional plants, combined with the demand for simplicity of small plants, makes it desirable to make improvements in this area [13].\nThe lifetime of methanol catalysts in industry is generally 2\u20134 years, when impurities are under control, but the activity of the catalysts\ndrops during this time span even in the absence of catalyst poisons [3,5,6,7,14] . Methanol plants usually counteract catalyst deactivation by\nadjustments of the synthesis pressure, recycle \ufb02ow, and/or synthesis temperature to maintain the productivity of the plant although these\nactions result in an increase in energy consumption.\nOne of the dreams in methanol synthesis is to make a more stable methanol synthesis catalyst and to avoid or reduce thermal deacti-\nvation during the industrial lifecycle. Sintering of methanol synthesis catalysts is complicated as it is not just Cu particles, but also ZnO and370 J. Sehested / Journal of Catalysis 371 (2019) 368\u2013375Al2O3particles that grow in size, and this may directly in\ufb02uence activity [15]. Detailed deactivation studies show a signi\ufb01cant restructuring\nof the catalyst [5,6] . Plants for making methanol from CO 2/H2gas mixtures are successfully designed with today\u2019s technology. However,\nmaking CO 2the primary carbon source of methanol increases steam partial pressures in the synthesis and tends to increase catalyst sin-\ntering. This is illustrated by the fact that Cu catalysts in general have lower Cu surface areas after exposure to low-temperature water gas\nshift conditions as compared with after methanol synthesis. It is therefore desirable to focus on thermal stability of methanol catalysts in\ngeneral and especially in CO 2to methanol applications, where the conditions are more challenging than when today \u00b4s more CO rich feeds\nare employed. Academia can play an important role in providing understanding and ideas for new and more durable methanol catalysts.\nThe CO 2conversion to methanol can also be improved by catalysts that only catalyze methanol synthesis and not the reverse water gas\nshift reaction (RWGS), the reverse of reaction (3). An additional advantage could be a decrease of the water content of the gas over the\ncatalyst and thereby possibly reduce water-induced sintering. Fig. 3 illustrates the equilibrium conversions after equilibrating the metha-\nnol reaction \u2013 with and without equilibrating the water gas shift reaction. An increase in the equilibrium conversion can be obtained at\nhigher temperatures and may have some applicability in adiabatic reactors, if the low temperature activity of today \u00b4s catalysts is main-\ntained, but using standard methanol synthesis temperatures seems more favorable for conversion. To evaluate industrial relevance, future\nwork should focus on CO formation at high conversions to methanol. It is also important to separate selectivity to CO from those of hydro-\ncarbons and C 2+ alcohols, because CO may be recycled while formation of higher alcohols, methane, higher hydrocarbons or wax repre-\nsents a loss of product and a separation or even a fouling problem.\nDecreasing byproduct formation could also result in optimized plant designs for example by increasing temperature in adiabatic and\ncooled reactors to increase activity and reduce reactor size and still obey the requirements of low byproducts or reduce the size of the dis-\ntillation section. Byproduct formation is presumably controlled by the reaction routes proposed for synthesis of higher alcohols over Cu\ncatalysts [16].\nFinally, it should be mentioned that other paths may be used to make methanol such as electrochemical reduction of CO 2-to-methanol\nand direct catalytic and non-catalytic oxidation of methane-to-methanol. The two latter processes are dif\ufb01cult due to high barriers for C AH\nactivation of methane and higher activity of C AH bonds in methanol [17,18] , and for the former, there are still huge technical challenges\n[19]. If we get a breakthrough for these processes, it will be highly interesting, and it will have the potential to transform industry and make\nsmall plants more feasible, but these processes are still far away from being industrially relevant. The focus that follows will therefore be on\nperspectives for the current industrial catalyst.\n4. Mechanism, carriers and promoters for methanol synthesis catalysts\nFirst, a few comments on the literature on methanol synthesis catalysts will be made. Although methanol synthesis catalysts represent a\nrelatively mature technology, it is still a dynamic research area with many new emerging directions and with several contradicting views\non fundamental catalytic aspects. It is possible to \ufb01nd support for nearly every hypothesis about the reaction mechanism, the active site\nand how promoters and carriers affect catalyst activity in the huge literature on these subjects. Thorough challenging scienti\ufb01c discussions\nare very stimulating, but previous results are sometimes not taken appropriately into account in newer reports. It is important that new\nmechanisms and concepts are suggested with great care and thoroughness, as the literature will otherwise tend to diverge rather than con-\nverge, and subsequent conclusions will be dif\ufb01cult to draw. It is perhaps a tendency that publication of new mechanisms or concepts are\neasier and more honorable than evaluating in detail whether the new \ufb01ndings indeed are substantial contributions leaving thorough test-\ning of new or older hypotheses as clean-up-work that can be overlooked. This means that the literature is growing, but solid coherent pic-\ntures do not necessarily emerge.\nCare is also important in the particularly interesting subject of new catalysts. It is important that proposed new formulations are tested\nat relevant synthesis conditions, where they can be compared directly with industrial type catalysts. Technical details should be suf\ufb01ciently\ndescribed to render reproduction and make a thorough evaluation possible. Furthermore, sometimes less active reference catalysts are\nused for comparison and it is recommended that new catalysts are compared not only on a turn-over-frequency (TOF) basis, but also\non a weight and volume basis with the current Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3catalyst that has high density and surface area of the active material. This\nwould make it easier to base new improvements on solid common knowledge in the \ufb01eld.\nNevertheless, the literature contains many excellent scienti\ufb01c reports including studies of catalyst formulations, preparations of Cu/ZnO\ncatalysts, mechanisms for methanol synthesis over Cu and Cu/ZnO catalysts, and interactions between Cu and ZnO, which will be discussed\nbrie\ufb02y below.\nFig. 3. Single pass carbon equilibrium conversions to methanol at 50 bar total pressure of a gas mixture containing 25% CO 2and 75% H 2with and without equilibrating the\nwater gas shift reaction.J. Sehested / Journal of Catalysis 371 (2019) 368\u2013375 371Research in methanol synthesis catalysts has been an active scienti\ufb01c area for decades and a boost in our knowledge was initiated by the\npioneering work of Klier [20] in the beginning of the 1980s, and new learnings have emerged throughout the years. The attention to metha-\nnol synthesis got a revival in the last 10\u201315 years with the growing awareness of CO 2emissions and renewable fuels, and the entrance of\nnew research groups into this scienti\ufb01c \ufb01eld. Still, we have not experienced a step change in this area since the 1960s, where the Cu/ZnO/\nAl2O3catalyst was invented and we must keep an eye on the objective of assisting advances in process technology and the development of\n\u2018\u2018clean\u201d and environmentally friendly solutions. Understanding of the present catalyst system, exploration of new preparation methods,\nand improved knowledge of new catalyst systems and promotors could all potentially lead to improved methanol synthesis catalysts,\nbut discovering new systems must have our special attention.\nThere are many reports on potential catalysts other than the Cu/ZnO chemical system, but so far none of these have emerged commer-\ncially. Several studies have obtained interesting results for Cu methanol synthesis catalysts using oxides of lanthanides and periods four\nand \ufb01ve elements as carriers and promotors [21\u201326] in CO 2/H2feeds. Furthermore, promotion of the Cu surface by precious metals [27]\nand recently non-Cu containing catalysts like Ni/Ga [11], MnO x/CoO x[28], InO x/ZrO 2[29] and ZnO/ZrO 2[30] catalysts were evaluated\nfor CO 2/H2to methanol. It seems that these catalysts cannot compete directly in their present form with the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3cat-\nalyst at low temperatures, where the methanol equilibrium is most favorable, due to price, selectivity and lower volume based activity at\nlower temperatures. Nevertheless, oxide catalysts expand our opportunities to make breakthrough discoveries and spur further academicinterest because they contain functionalities that are complementary to the industrial metal-based catalysts and this group of materials is\ncertainly an interesting research area to explore.\nA large number of papers have reported on the preparation of Cu/ZnO catalysts. Boosting the interaction between Cu and ZnO to opti-\nmize methanol synthesis catalysts is of great scienti\ufb01c interest and has also positive industrial prospects. Considerable progress was made\nin this area for example by the thorough work of Behrens et al. [31] and the optimization study of Baltes et al. [32], giving both a deep\nunderstanding of each step in the preparation and improved synthesis parameters. Several variations in the preparation methods were\nexplored, including addition of Ga and Mg [33], various amounts of Al [33] and new preparation methods [34]. Suitable catalysts for bench-\nmarking explorative catalysts can be found in references [32,33] .\nThe reaction mechanism for methanol synthesis over Cu was studied in a large number of papers using kinetic isotope experiments,\nab initio calculations, kinetic experiments [24,35\u201340] and advanced characterization methods [41,42] . Experiments with isotopically\nmarked CO and CO\n2show that CO 2is the preferred carbon precursor for methanol formation over Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3catalysts at low conversion\n[35,37] in agreement with more fundamental work showing that only CO 2and not CO is converted to methanol over Cu single crystals [43].\nConversion of CO/H 2is possible over Cu supported on basic carriers [35,44] and on single crystals and polycrystalline Cu, when promoted\nwith alkali metals [45,46] . Interestingly, Cu/ZrO 2catalysts seem to perform well in both CO/H 2and CO 2/H2gas mixtures [25], while Cu/ZnO\nis not operating well in pure CO/H 2mixtures [47]. It is surprising that Cu lanthanides have recently been reported to be superior for CO 2/H2\nto methanol as it appears to contradict previous work showing that CO/H 2gas mixtures are preferred for making methanol over Cu par-\nticles on basic supports [35,44] .\nRecent state of the art total energy calculations/ab initio studies and microkinetic modelling have advanced our knowledge about the\nreaction mechanism of CO and CO 2to methanol [35,48,49] .C O 2-to-methanol is described to proceed via hydrogenation of formate to\nmethanol via H 2COOH, formaldehyde, and methoxy species, while CO reacts via successive hydrogenation to formaldehyde, methoxy\nand methanol.\n5. Cu \u2013 Zn interactions\nToday, all commercial catalysts contain Cu and ZnO1, which raises the question of whether zinc is unique and the only relevant promoter\nfor Cu-based methanol catalysts? The role of ZnO in the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3methanol synthesis catalyst has attracted a lot of attention in\nthe literature and is a very interesting subject scienti\ufb01cally, not only in itself, but also due to the analogy with other metal-promoter systems.\nThere is a strong consensus and overwhelming evidence in the literature that ZnO is an excellent electronic and structural (by increasing Cu\ndispersion) promoter for methanol formation over Cu [14,15,35,40,50\u201356] . Just to highlight a few recent studies, Kurz et al. [55] achieved an\nimprovement in activity of nearly a factor of three upon addition of zinc to a Cu/Al 2O3catalyst and van den Berg et al. [51] measured an\nincrease in activity of \ufb01ve to seven times after zinc addition to Cu/SiO 2or Cu/C catalysts. Nakamura and Fujitani [39,52,57,58] estimate a\nsix and thirteen times improvement in methanol activity when adding twenty surface mole % of Zn to polycrystalline Cu and Cu(1 1 1) before\nmethanol synthesis, respectively, while Kattel et al. [40,54] claim a 25 to 90 times higher activity upon deposition of twenty mole % ZnO on Cu\n(1 1 1). So there is agreement about a signi\ufb01cant increase in activity of Cu catalysts after zinc addition. One exception is the work of Waugh and\ncoworkers [59,60] , who claim that zinc is only a structural promoter based on similar TOFs for a series of catalysts calculated from activity\nmeasurements and Cu surface areas obtained by N 2O-RFC (reactive frontal chromatography) [59]. Although nano-crystalline ZnO helps dis-\npersing Cu nanoparticles in commercial catalysts, the use of N 2O-RFC may be sidetracked by oxidation of reduced Zn or oxygen vacancies\nin ZnO [61,62] .\nWhile the consensus is strong concerning the existence of the promotional effect of zinc in Cu catalysts, the structure of the active site is\nstill discussed. The origin of the Cu\u2013ZnO synergy is an architype of metal-promoter structure and is one of the most studied examples of\ncatalyst synergy. Quite a number of different models for the origin of this Cu\u2013ZnO synergy have been proposed [6,15,20,38,40\u201342,48,49,52\u2013\n54,56\u201359,63\u201373] . Scienti\ufb01c discussions have recently focused on Cu shape changes and consequently exposure of more active Cu facets\n[65,68,71] , on Cu-ZnO interface sites, for example, at the edges of ZnO overlayers on Cu surfaces [6,40,54,63,64,67] and on partly reduced\nsingle Zn atoms in the surface of Cu [15,35,42,50,52,53,57] . While these models appear contradictory to each other, they may in principle\ncoexist as discussed further below and to some extent re\ufb02ect different structural responses of the same dynamic phenomenon [15,72] . The\ncritical issues are therefore \ufb01nding their relative contributions to the methanol synthesis reaction rate, determine whether these effects are\ninterlinked or collaborate and establish how the improved understanding can be used to develop the catalyst.\n1Zn, ZnO, and zinc are used to describe single zinc atoms in the Cu surface, zinc atoms that are part of a zinc oxide sheet or crystal and zinc atoms in an unsp eci\ufb01ed structure,\nrespectively.372 J. Sehested / Journal of Catalysis 371 (2019) 368\u2013375The view on the Cu-ZnO synergy has evolved over the years by employing sophisticated characterization tools and theoretical methods\nsuch as Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared studies (IR), adsorption mea-\nsurements, and density functional theory (DFT). These approaches have given insight into the highly dynamic behavior of Cu nanoparticles\nsupported at larger ZnO particles under operating conditions and demonstrated that the shape of the Cu nanoparticles adjust to the reac-\ntion conditions [65,68,71,73] . These shape changes were attributed to changes in the interface energies of Cu on ZnO and more recently to\nZn atoms in the Cu surface [15]; i.e., Zn atoms in the surface of Cu particles have an impact on Cu particle shape because the particle surface\nenergies are reduced by Zn atoms and will thus tend to decrease the contact angles for Cu particles on \ufb02at supports. Similarly, oxygen\nvacancies in ZnO at the Cu-ZnO interface could increase the interface energies and hence decrease the contact angle.\nTransient variations in activity with changes in gas reduction potential were ascribed to dissimilar rates of methanol synthesis over dif-\nferent Cu facets. Nonetheless, single crystal measurements suggest only a difference of approximately 2\u20132.5 in area speci\ufb01c activity\nbetween Cu(1 1 1) and Cu(1 1 0), when the surface densities of the facets are taken into account [57,74,75] , while microkinetic modelling\nindicates a stronger effect [68]. Interestingly, recent DFT calculations propose that the methanol activity over Cu is extremely structure-\nsensitive and dominated by a few step atoms with and without Zn atom substitution of Cu surface atoms [35,42] . In this picture, the sim-\nilarity of the activities of different Cu facets could be due to a few strong binding defect sites dominating the overall methanol activity. A\nlinear dependency between activity and formate coverage (after evacuation at 100 /C176C) for a series of different Cu single crystal facets and Zn\npromoted Cu facets [39], may possibly be understood in the light of this theory-based hypothesis.\nThe concept of shape changes is well documented and interesting as it demonstrates that the shape of the Cu particles will adjust to the\ncomposition of the gas mixture and interactions with the surrounding ceramic spacers/promotors such as ZnO and Al 2O3, seemingly leav-\ning little room to maintain an initially prepared large fraction of a highly active Cu facet that is thermodynamically unstable at the syn-\nthesis conditions. While the dynamic shapes gave an account for many phenomena, there were also observations that they could not\naccount for. IR and EELS measurements suggested that Zn could be incorporated into the Cu surfaces and this gives a hint that the Zn alloy-\ning itself could be the cause of the shape changes and also the root cause for the promoted activity [15,50,72,76] . At Topsoe, we therefore\nstudied this mechanism in detail in industrial type catalysts.\nRecently, we proposed a quantitative model that describes the Zn promoting effect by incorporation of reduced Zn into the Cu surface\n[15]. Brie\ufb02y, ZnO particles and Zn alloying in Cu particles are in thermodynamic equilibrium with CO and CO 2in the gas phase and can be\ndescribed analytically using well established thermodynamic data from the literature. DFT was applied to calculate segregation energies of\nZn in Cu as a simple \u2018\u2018broken-bond-model\u201d [56] was not suf\ufb01ciently precise to give a satisfying description. We estimated the overall cov-\nerages of Zn at the surface of Cu particles as a function of the CO/CO 2ratio from the coverages of Zn on Cu at a series of Cu facets assuming a\ncubo-octahedral shape of the Cu particles. This model compared well with experimental Zn coverages determined from the loss of Cu areas\nas determined by H 2-TPD (temperature programmed desorption). Finally, we veri\ufb01ed the effect on activity of these Zn-Cu sites in the Cu\nsurface.\nThis model explains some of the key observations reported in the literature such as dynamic shape effects, transient changes in activity\nand activity variations with CO/CO 2ratios [15]. It is also in excellent agreement with the catalyst and single crystal work of Fujitani and\nNakamura [57], who conclude that CO 2hydrogenation to methanol is promoted by reduced Zn atoms and disclose that formate, preferably\nattached to Zn in the Cu surface, is the precursor for methanol formation. Interestingly, the model predicts that methanol activity of Cu/ZnO\ncatalysts does not only depend on the active Cu surface area, but also on ZnO promoter particle sizes due to the increase in thermodynamic\nactivity of Zn and thereby the coverage of Zn at Cu with decreasing ZnO particle size. A perhaps more surprising effect is that Zn coverages\ndecrease for smaller Cu particle sizes lending smaller Cu particles to be less ef\ufb01ciently promoted by Zn than larger Cu particles, i.e., lower\nTOF for smaller Cu particles. Such an effect was recently reported by van den Berg et al. [51], but this comparison should be done with the\nreservation that changes in the fractions of active sites, possibly B 5or B 6sites [42], with particle size, are not included in the model. The\nmodel provides at present the most detailed description of the Cu-ZnO synergy in methanol synthesis catalysts as it includes the depen-\ndencies on Cu and ZnO particle sizes as well as reaction conditions. The model therefore offers a basis for further improvements of indus-\ntrial catalysts and for making predictions that may be tested further.\nThis picture was recently questioned by Rodriguez and coworkers [40,64] , who argued that ZnO layers over Cu and/or Cu-ZnO interface\nsites constitute the active site for methanol synthesis. These authors performed experimental studies of methanol synthesis from CO 2and\nH2at a pressure of 5 atm. over ZnO deposited on Cu(1 1 1), Cu and ZnO deposited on ZnO(000 1/C0\n) and theoretical investigations of Zn 6O7H7\nislands over Cu(1 1 1). As outlined above critical focus on discrepancies can be of extraordinary importance to advance our understanding\nof structure-function relations in catalysis. However, in a following discussion of this work [53,54] , it turned out that one of the main exper-\nimental observations, i.e. the presence of ZnO after activity tests, were included in previous XPS measurements by Fujitani and Nakamura\n[58], who, through additional thorough experiments reported in a series of papers [39,52,57] , showed that more elaborate measurements\nwould have been needed for Rodriguez et al. to unambiguously determine the chemical state of zinc. This discussion re\ufb02ects that the\nmature literature on the fundamental science in methanol synthesis by Cu/ZnO catalysts should be consulted in depth in attempts to make\nnovel breakthroughs.\nNevertheless, depicting the active site in Cu/ZnO catalysts at the interface between Cu and ZnO particles and/or at the edge of ZnO over-\nlayers over Cu still needs to be carefully considered due to the amount of evidence for these type of active structures [6,40,54,63,64,67] and\nthe similarity with other methanol-active Cu-oxide systems [24,25,26] . In my view, reduced Zn atoms in a Cu surface are active for metha-\nnol synthesis [15,35,39,42,50,52,53,57] , and the concentration of Zn in the active Cu particles is governed by catalyst morphology, catalyst\ncomposition, Cu and ZnO particle sizes, synthesis conditions and thermodynamics [15]. This is apparently a property that to some extent\nmakes zinc unique compared with other promoters/carriers that have a promoting effect on Cu and this may be the reason why ZnO is still\nused commercially after 50 years of service. Nonetheless, Kuld et al. [50] report that N 2O-RFC and H 2-TPD provide similar Cu surface areas\nfor an industrial type methanol synthesis catalyst reduced at 10 mbar H 2at 220 /C176C. However, adopting the newly reported H 2:Cu stoi-\nchiometry [61,62] , results in 25% lower Cu surface areas determined by H 2-TPD than those reported in [50] and this indicates the existence\nof additional reduced sites that are accessible for N 2O, but not titrated by H 2. Interestingly, Cu+1is found in detailed surface characterization\nstudies after a mild reduction of Cu/ZnO/SiO 2catalysts [41]. One could speculate that oxygen vacancy sites at the Cu-ZnO interface or at the\nrim of the Cu particles could give the additional oxygen uptake from N 2O[50,61,62] and may be active for methanol synthesis, especially inJ. Sehested / Journal of Catalysis 371 (2019) 368\u2013375 373less reducing gas mixtures, i.e., at low CO/CO 2ratios, where the steady state coverage of reduced Zn in the Cu surface is relatively low [15].\nThese considerations suggest that while Zn-Cu is documented as the active site for methanol synthesis under typical industrial reaction\nconditions, a corporative Cu-ZnO site may also contribute under more oxidizing conditions and this dual site model could be relevant\nto elucidate in further detail.\n6. Conclusions\nMethanol is a large-scale bulk chemical that is currently manufactured from common fossil hydrocarbon feedstocks. Methanol synthesis\nis one of the possible solutions to the energy challenges that we face in the 21st century as it may be produced from renewable resources\nand has an energy density that allows demanding long-distance transport without refueling. Methanol is also an excellent precursor for\nmaking many bulk chemicals including ole\ufb01ns, formaldehyde, acetic acid, methyl chloride, DME, dimethyl terephthalate, etc.\nOne of the main challenges in lowering the environmental footprint of the methanol industry, using small rural gas supplies, biomass\ngasi\ufb01cation or CO 2waste streams combined with H 2from electrolysis, is the demand for more economic solutions for smaller production\nplants. It will be dif\ufb01cult for smaller plants to compete with new world class-methanol-plants fueled by cheap natural gas on an equal basis\nso subsidies and regulations will be needed in a transition period. However, in a low CO 2emission society, where \ufb02aring is unacceptable,\nsmall-scale methanol production could be attractive. The main route to methanol in a foreseeable future is still thermal via synthesis gas as\nmethanol production via direct electrolysis, photo-catalysis, non-catalytic synthesis and direct methane-to-methanol synthesis, all need\nmajor technological breakthroughs to be commercially interesting.\nToday \u00b4s technology provides an applicable solution for combining CO 2and H 2to make methanol, although the industrial methanol syn-\nthesis catalyst is slightly less ef\ufb01cient and shows somewhat faster thermal sintering in CO 2rich feed gasses. Making the industrial metha-\nnol catalyst even more stable could be interesting, but a really attractive improvement could be to enhance the low temperature activity of\nthe methanol synthesis catalyst since lower temperatures would allow better equilibrium conditions, lower synthesis pressures, and\nthereby decrease the demand for expensive compression especially in smaller productions. Ef\ufb01cient handling of impurities is also an issue\nespecially in the light of some unconventional impurities present in alternative feed gasses and in this connection a sulfur tolerant synthe-\nsis could be highly interesting. Both increasing the knowledge and \ufb01nding simpli\ufb01ed solutions to these challenges is of industrial\nimportance.\nDevelopment and understanding of methanol synthesis catalysts are still very active research areas. We could hope that we in the\nfuture, based on experimental evidence, obtain a theoretical description with predictive power to strengthen our search for catalysts with\nhigher low temperature activity or resistance towards impurities.\nAcknowledgement\nI would like to thank Stig Helveg, Martin Skov Skj\u00f8th-Rasmussen and Henrik Guldberg Pedersen for careful reading of manuscript and\nmany valuable comments and suggestions.\nReferences\n[1]https://igpenergy.com/methanol-overview/ ,https://www.methanol.org/the-methanol-industry/ .\n[2]G.A.

However, big challenges remain in developing remote sensing-based models for mapping \nconcentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide (cCO2) in lakes at regional or global scales. We developed a cCO2 \nestimation model using Sentinel-3-derived lake environmental variables and near-synchronous field cCO2 data \nfrom 16 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai River (ML_YHR) basins in Eastern China \n(N =248). Stepwise quadratic polynomial regressions of several combinations of chlorophyll- a (Chl-a), water \ntemperature (Tw), Secchi disk depth (ZSD), and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR)-related variables were \ntested and validated to select the best approach. The final model showed high performance in calibration and \nvalidation (R2 >0.72, RMSE <6.35 \u03bcmol L\u00001, MAPE <30.31%). The model sensitivity analysis, based on Monte \nCarlo simulations, showed the model \u2019s estimated bias as <25% based on uncertainties of all input variables. \nSpatial and temporal dynamics of dissolved CO2 concentrations in 113 lakes (\u226510 km2) in the ML_YHR basins \nwere mapped from 2016 to 2021 using the Sentinel-3 data. The result showed that CO2 concentrations were low \nin the summer and autumn but high in the winter and spring with dramatic variations (e.g., mean coefficient of \nvariation: 52.59%). The annual mean CO2 concentrations of lakes revealed that about 28% of the lakes acted as \nweak atmospheric CO2 sinks (14.96 \u00b11.13 \u03bcmol L\u00001) while the rest were sources (19.22 \u00b12.02 \u03bcmol L\u00001), \ncompared with a mean concentration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium (16.29 \u03bcmol L\u00001). CO2 concentrations \ndecreased with increasing eutrophication and decreasing lake size (p <0.05). This study advances current \nknowledge about CO2 emissions from emerging meso-eutrophic lakes and shows how satellite remote sensing can \nexpand the spatiotemporal coverage of lake CO2.   \n1.Introduction \nLakes play an essential role in the carbon cycle as they emit green -\nhouse gas equivalent to nearly 20% of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions \n(DelSontro et al., 2018 ) despite their small surface area, which is only \nabout 3.7% of the global non-glacial land area (Verpoorter et al., 2014 ). \nHowever, current bottom-up estimates of CO2 emissions from lakes have \nsignificant uncertainties due to the lack of in situ data. One of the crucial \nreasons for these uncertainties is the large bias of lake type in the global \nlake datasets used in the global emission estimation. Global warming \nand nutrient enrichment due to agriculture and urbanization has increased eutrophication of lakes since the 20th century (Ho et al., \n2019 ). About 63.1% of global lakes larger than 25 km2 are already \neutrophic, covering about 30.5% of the water surface area (Wang et al., \n2018 ). Eutrophication can largely affect the aquatic carbon cycle by \npromoting atmospheric carbon sequestration as sediment and dissolved \norganic carbon (Pacheco et al., 2014 ). However, only <1% of the 7939 \nlakes and reservoirs in the dataset of Raymond et al. (2013) represent \neutrophic lakes, and most of them are boreal lakes north of the 40\u25e6N \nlatitude, resulting in a lack of representativeness of lake types and \nregional distribution, which hinders accurate estimation of global lake \nCO2 emissions. \n*Corresponding author at: 73 East Beijing Road, Nanjing 210008, China. \nE-mail address: htduan@niglas.ac.cn (H.

The increased inputs of terrestrial carbon \nentering the lake with nutrients increase the lake\u2019s CO2 (Weyhenmeyer \net al., 2015 ). On the other hand, the algae emerging with increasing \nnutrients promote primary productivity and reduce the lake CO2 \n(Pacheco et al., 2014 ). The unclear counterbalance of these two pro-\ncesses results in complex carbon cycle roles that create many problems \nfor eutrophic lakes (DelSontro et al., 2018 ; Loken et al., 2019 ; Borges \net al., 2022 ). Specifically, even in tropical lakes reported to be strong \nemitters of CO2 into the atmosphere (Marotta et al., 2009 ), eutrophi -\ncation induces high Chl-a, which leads to undersaturated dissolved CO2 \nthat acts as CO2 sinks (Borges et al., 2022 ). As an eutrophic lake in \ntemperate regions, Lake Mendota shows dramatic seasonal CO2 varia -\ntions (6.8\u2013184.3 \u03bcmol L\u00001) and significant spatial heterogeneity in the \nautumn mixing period (Loken et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, eutrophication \ncan offset or even reverse carbon emissions from an oligotrophic lake \n(Pacheco et al., 2014 ). The size-productivity weighted upscaling esti-\nmates of global lakes by DelSontro et al. (2018) were about 50% lower \nthan the estimation based on size weighted upscaling alone, which also \nproved the importance of eutrophic lakes in global lake CO2 emission \nestimates. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of labor and material \nresources, it is impossible for field sampling to cover all the lakes within \nthe higher frequency than quarterly or annually (Raymond et al., 2013 ; \nHolgerson and Raymond, 2016 ). New large-scale approaches need to be \ndeveloped to fulfill the need to monitor the high spatiotemporal varia -\ntions in lakes \u2019 CO2. \nSatellite remote sensing has accumulated massive continuous \nobservation data owing to its broad coverage and high spatiotemporal \nresolution. Based on massive satellite-to-field matchups and high- \nprecision satellite products, remote sensing methods have become \nessential for synoptic estimation of oceanic surface dissolved CO2 (Bai \net al., 2015 ; Chen et al., 2016 ; Chen et al., 2019a ). In principle, the \noceanic surface dissolved CO2 concentration is mainly controlled by \nthermodynamic processes, biological activities, and physical mixing \n(Takahashi et al., 2002 ; Biswas et al., 2004 ; Takahashi et al., 2009 ). \nThese processes can be simulated by satellite-derivable variables such as \nsea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), Chl-a, and the \ndownwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd) (Bai et al., 2015 ; Chen \net al., 2016 ; Lohrenz et al., 2018 ). As the sea gets closer to the land, the \ninteraction between oceanic CO2-controlling processes and their related \nfactors gets stronger, complicating the CO2 estimation model. In open \noceans, dissolved CO2 is mainly controlled by the thermodynamic pro-\ncess, and can be estimated by sea surface temperatures using simple \nlinear regression (Boutin et al., 1999 ). In relatively closed bays or coastal \nareas (e.g., the Gulf of Mexico, the Baltic Sea, and the East China Sea) \nwhere biological and river-sea interactions are enhanced, nonlinear al-\ngorithms (e.g., polynomial regression, semi-analytics, machine learning \nalgorithms) are required. Variables related to biological processes (Chl- \na, Kd), physical mixing (SSS) and thermodynamic processes (SST) are \nalso necessary inputs used to jointly describe the dynamics of dissolved \nCO2 (Bai et al., 2015 ; Chen et al., 2016 ; Parard et al., 2016 ; Lohrenz \net al., 2018 ). However, models developed for specific sea areas have \nlimitations in regional extrapolation performance. Massive multi- \nregional representative field data and more complicated algorithms (e. \ng., semi-analytical and machine learning algorithms) are needed to \ndevelop models with general applicability for more sea areas (Chen \net al., 2017 ; Chen et al., 2019a ). \nUnlike the way it\u2019s handled in the ocean, dissolved CO2 in lakes is \ncontrolled by endogenous biological effects, thermodynamics, physical \nmixing, and exogenous terrestrial organic and inorganic carbon input \nfrom rivers (Tranvik et al., 2009 ). In particular, due to the relatively \nsmall volume of lakes, the exchange of material and energy between \nlakes and terrestrial ecosystems via rivers and lake shorelines is intense, \nprofoundly affecting various endogenous biochemical processes in lakes \n(Cole et al., 2007 ; Tranvik et al., 2009 ). In addition to predicting lake \nthermal processes, the water temperature can also indicate photosynthesis intensity together with Chl-a and Kd (Qi et al., 2020 ). \nDissolved organic carbon (DOC) and coloured dissolved organic matter \n(CDOM) are potential predictors of dissolved CO2, because they are in-\ndicators of organic matter mineralization processes or exogenous inputs \nthat lead to a CO2 increase (Sobek et al., 2005 ; Raymond et al., 2013 ; \nKlaus et al., 2019 ). However, most lakes lack accurate satellite products \nof the variables discussed in this section. Few studies are currently \navailable on the use of satellite products to estimate lake CO2, which has \nseverely limited the expansion of long-term remote sensing data \n(Campbell et al., 2022 ). There are only exploratory studies on Lake \nM\u00a8alaren (Kutser et al., 2015 ), Lake Erie (Ouyang et al., 2017 ), and Lake \nTaihu (Qi et al., 2020 ). Among them, a relatively mature study by Qi \net al. (2020) represents the best model (Taihu model) developed for the \nmost well-known eutrophic shallow lake in China - Lake Taihu. This \nstudy reconstructs nearly 20 years of dissolved CO2 in Lake Taihu, \nthereby proving the potential of satellite remote sensing for long-term \nmonitoring of lake CO2 dynamics. However, due to the heterogeneity \nof biogeochemical processes among different types of lakes, it is unclear \nwhether the Taihu model can be applied to other lakes worldwide. \nConsiderable differences have been found in the optical properties \nbetween lakes as well as between seasons for the same lake, leading to \ngreat challenges in developing a uniform algorithm for regional or \nglobal lakes (Shen et al., 2020 ; Pahlevan et al., 2022 ). For instance, lakes \nin the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai River \n(ML_YHR) basins include several types of lakes, from mesotrophic to \nhighly eutrophic (Hu et al., 2022 ). The highly eutrophic lakes with \nfrequent cyanobacterial blooms in the ML_YHR basins include Lake \nTaihu in the Yangtze Delta and Lake Chaohu in Hefei (the capital of the \nAnhui Province) (Duan et al., 2015 ; Duan et al., 2017 ). Besides, there are \nalso lakes with a lower eutrophication and a high river \u2013lake connectivity \nwith large amounts of suspended matter, such as Lake Hongze, Poyang, \nand Dongting (Hou et al., 2017 ; Shen et al., 2020 ). MODIS data has \nabout two decades of earth observations; however, many algorithms \nbased on MODIS data were developed for monitoring the long-term \ndynamics of a single lake (e.g., Lake Taihu) (Shi et al., 2015a ; Shi \net al., 2015b ; Huang et al., 2017 ). Mature MODIS-based water quality \nparameters algorithms for inland waters have not been fully developed \nto date (e.g., Chl-a), because MODIS was developed for open ocean \nwaters and does not have spectral bands in the red and NIR part of the \nspectrum which is critical for estimating Chl-a in eutrophic waters \n(Gitelson, 1992 ; Cao et al., 2022b ). The Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land \nColour Instrument (OLCI) performance in retrieving water quality pa-\nrameters in lakes has been well demonstrated by different authors (Xue \net al., 2019 ; Shen et al., 2020 ; Soomets et al., 2020a ; Soomets et al., \n2020b ; Pahlevan et al., 2022 ), since it was developed specifically for \ncoastal and inland waters. MODIS is also close to the end of its life, while \nfunding for the next Sentinel-3 (C, D and onward) is secured for decades \nto come. Therefore, we chose to use the OLCI sensor for evaluating the \nlake CO2 even though it has shorter time series at present. Existing \nstudies have achieved a high-precision inversion of the primary optical \nparameters (e.g., Chl-a and ZSD) for lakes in the ML_YHR basins based on \nthe Sentinel-3 OLCI data (Xu et al., 2019 ; Shen et al., 2020 ). Standard \nsurface temperatures and photosynthetic active radiation products \nderived from Sentinel-3 data have been released, which meet the basic \nrequirements of the Taihu CO2 model proposed by Qi et al. (2020) . \nMoreover, the reconstruction of dissolved cCO2 in eutrophic lakes will \nhelp fill the gap in the current global lake dataset, which is of great \nsignificance for reducing uncertainty concerning the global lake CO2 \nemission estimation. \nThis study was conducted to achieve three objectives: (1) to \nconstruct a high-precision dissolved CO2 concentration estimation \nmodel suitable for lakes in the ML_YHR basins based on Sentinel-3 data; \n(2) to evaluate the performance and uncertainty of the model by veri-\nfying the results with our independent data and comparing with the \nexisting research in the ML_YHR basins; (3) to reconstruct a multi-year \nseries of dissolved CO2 concentrations for lakes in the ML_YHR basins T. Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n3based on all available multi-year Sentinel-3 satellite data from May 2016 \nto December 2021. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to \nestimate dissolved CO2 in lakes from space at a regional scale. \n2.Data and methods \n2.1. Study areas \nThe middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai River \n(ML_YHR) basins are located in the eastern plain of China (27.78\u25e6- \n36.10\u25e6N, 111.70\u25e6-121.67\u25e6E, Fig. 1). The ML_YHR basins are in a sub-\ntropical monsoon climate region with favorable hydrothermal condi -\ntions and abundant water sources to replenish the lakes within it. The \nML_YHR basins includes 605 natural lakes (excluding reservoirs) larger \nthan 1 km2, with a total lake area of 20,762 km2 (Ma et al., 2011 ). Due to \nthe fast-growing social and economic development of eastern China in \nthe last half century, a large amount of nitrogen-rich sewage was dis-\ncharged into lakes (Yu et al., 2019 ). This excess nitrogen led to the \ndeterioration of aquatic ecosystems and fast eutrophication of ML_YHR \nlakes (Hu et al., 2022 ). The frequent occurrence of cyanobacterial \nblooms endangers the ecological health of lakes and the lives of sur-\nrounding residents (Duan et al., 2015 ; Duan et al., 2017 ). At the same \ntime, eutrophication dramatically changed the CO2 emission dynamics \nin lakes, making lakes in this region a hotspot for lake-related carbon \ncycle research (Lee et al., 2014 ; Ran et al., 2021 ; Xiao et al., 2022 ). In \nthis study, considering the limitations of the spatial resolution \n(approximately 300 m) of the Sentinel-3 OLCI data, 113 lakes (>10 km2) \nlocated in the ML_YHR basins were examined (Fig. 1). 2.2. Field data \nBased on lake sizes, hydrological conditions, and the trophic status of \nthe lakes reported in published studies (Zou et al., 2020 ; Hu et al., 2022 ), \n16 lakes were selected in the ML_YHR basins (as shown in Fig. 1 with \nbasic properties shown in Table 1). Six field surveys were conducted in \nJuly 2018, October 2019, September and October 2020, and April, June, \nand December 2021. For samplings of each lake, 5 to 30 sample points \nwere set in the lake\u2019s pelagic area and carried out simultaneously with \nSentinel-3 overpasses. At each sampling site, surface water samples \n(0\u201350 cm) were collected to analyses water quality and optical param -\neters (including Chl-a, DOC, CDOM absorbance, and suspended partic -\nulate matter (SPM)). A standard 5 L acrylic water-fetching instrument \nwas used to collect the water. The samples were stored in cold dark \nconditions before laboratory analysis. The specific measurement \nmethods have been detailed in previous studies (Xue et al., 2017 ; Xiao \net al., 2020 ). For dissolved cCO2 measurements, a headspace equilib -\nrium method based on the workflow of Goldenfum (2010) and Striegl \net al. (2012) was used. In short, about 16 mL of bubble-free surface \nwater samples were injected through a 20 mL polypropylene syringe \ninto 30-mL glass serum bottles. The syringe was fitted with a three-way \nstopcock and a 1.2-\u03bcm syringe filter. The serum bottles had been pre-\nviously flushed with N2 at atmospheric pressure and sealed with stop-\npers at the laboratory. Serum bottles also contained 2 g of potassium \nchloride (KCl) to inhibit microbial activity. CO2 gas volume fractions in \nthe headspace gas were measured using a gas chromatograph (Agilent- \n7890B) in the laboratory. cCO2 at field conditions were calculated using \nmeasured headspace gas volume fractions, averaged total barometric \npressure at the sample collection site, field water temperatures, \nFig. 1.Map of lakes larger than 10 km2 in the study area.

A total \nof 669 sample points were obtained (Table 1). The main parameters of \neach lake varied in a wide range, and their distribution was close to the \npositively skewed distribution, which was representative of the study \narea (Fig. S1). \n2.3. Satellite data \nBenefitting from the band setting and spatial resolution, the Sentinel- \n3 OLCI is considered one of the most suitable satellite sensors for water \ncolour remote sensing in inland waters (IOCCG, 2018 ). Previous study \nhas proved the cross-mission consistency of data obtained by OLCI \nsensors equipped on Sentinel-3 A and B (Zibordi et al., 2022 ). Therefore, \nwe used the OLCI data that both Sentinel-3 A and B obtained to retrieve \nthe lakes \u2019 optical parameters. Our goal was to obtain the maximum \nnumber of valid images. The Sentinel-3 A/B OLCI level-1B FR and the \nSea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) level-2 land \nsurface temperature (LST) images were downloaded from the European \nSpace Agency (ESA) Copernicus Open Access Hub. These images cover \nthe ML_YHR basins between May 2016 and December 2021. Image \nquality control and selection were done with the following preprocess -\ning. The Sentinel-3 OLCI level-2 instantaneous PAR (iPAR) product was \ndownloaded from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) with online data access at \nhttps://data.eumetsat.int/ . The MODIS 3 km aerosol product \n(MOD04_3K) was required as an input to the atmospheric correction and \nwas downloaded from NASA \u2019s Earth Observing System Data and Infor-\nmation System (EOSDIS, https://earthdata.nasa.gov ). \nDownloaded satellite data were preprocessed following the steps \nshown in Fig. 2. First, the satellite data were roughly subset using the \nlake boundary published by Ma et al. (2011) . Then, the Rayleigh- \ncorrected reflectance (Rrc) and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) were \nderived using the satellite signal in the solar spectrum correction scheme \n(6SV) (Vermote et al., 1997 ). Shen et al. (2020) proved the performance \nof the 6SV processor in large lakes of eastern China, based on compar -\nisons with current popular atmospheric correction processors. The spe-\ncific options of 6SV processor followed Shen et al. (2020) and are shown \nin the supplementary material (Text S1). The Chl-a and ZSD algorithms in \nML_YHR lakes were developed based on random forest regression using \nOLCI Rrs data by Shen et al. (2020, 2022) . The Chl-a algorithm achieved \nhigh accuracy for eutrophic and turbid inland lakes across eastern China \n(R2 =0.73, RMSE =12.99 \u03bcg L\u00001, MAPE =36.91%) (Shen et al., 2022 ). \nThe Chl-a algorithm was also validated by our measured data and \nshowed high accuracy in ML_YHR lakes (R2 =0.82, RMSE =8.54 \u03bcg L\u00001, \nMAPE =29.61%, Fig. S2 a). The ZSD algorithm had high accuracy for \neutrophic and turbid inland lakes across eastern China (R2 =0.70, \nRMSE =0.13 m, MAPE =33.43%) (Shen et al., 2020 ). The ZSD algorithm \nalso showed high accuracy in ML_YHR lakes (R2 =0.84, RMSE =0.07 m, \nMAPE =14.07%, Fig. S2 b). \nLevel-2 satellite products were first subset and resampled to obtain \ndatasets consistent with Rrs data. The Sentinel-3 OLCI level-2 iPAR \nproduct showed good accuracy in ML_YHR lakes (R2 =0.90, RMSE =Table 1 \nName, area, depth, number of stations, and main parameters of the 16 sampled lakes in this study.

Because the diurnal \nvariation of iPAR follows a quadratic function (R2 =0.65, p <0.01, \nFig. S3 a), we used a quadratic function to fit the diurnal iPAR variation \nusing the satellite observation time, Sentinel-3 iPAR products, sunrise, \nand sunset time. The sunrise and sunset time were calculated through \nthe date, longitude and latitude of each lake. Then, a series of variables \nrelated to time and radiation were derived. They are: (1) the observation \ntime of the satellite passing over the selected sites or sampling converted \nto the ratio of 24 h (Ts, dimensionless); (2) duration between sunrise and \nobservation time (Drs in hours); (3) accumulated PAR total obtained by \nintegrating with the daily curve of iPAR from sunrise to observation time \n(aPAR, in Einstein m\u00002); (4) daily accumulated PAR obtained by inte-\ngrating with the daily curve of iPAR from sunrise to sunset (AccuPAR, in \nEinstein m\u00002 d\u00001); (5) the ratio of aPAR to AccuPAR (ks, dimensionless). \nAccuPAR calculated based on Sentinel-3 iPAR products are highly \nconsistent with in situ data (R2 =0.96, RMSE =3.68 Einstein m\u00002 s\u00001, \nMAPE =9.04%, Fig. S3 c), which proves the rationality of the fitting curve of daily iPAR and the five constructed variables just mentioned in \nthis paragraph. The iPAR and the five constructed variables were used as \nmodel inputs to participate in model calibration. The spatial resolution \nof the LST product is 1 km, which is different from the OLCI data. \nHowever, it has been verified that the product could reflect spatiotem -\nporal water temperature variations (R2 =0.96, RMSE =1.28 \u25e6C, MAPE \n=5.2%, Fig. S3 d). At the same time, there was no significant difference \nbetween pixels within the lake (mean coefficient of variation <15%). \nThus, the land surface temperature (LST) products were only resampled \nto the exact spatial resolution of the OLCI data and used as a water \ntemperature (Tw) parameter input for model calibration. \nFinally, suboptimal observation conditions such as sunglint, clouds, \nland, and algal scum pixels were masked for all products used in this \nstudy. The automated water delineation algorithm proposed by Wang \net al. (2014) was used to identify the water pixels and mask land pixels \naccurately. Three water pixels near the land boundary were excluded to \nremove the pixels near the land possibly contaminated by the land \nFig. 2.Schematic block diagram illustrating the primary process of satellite data processing and model development.

Cloud pixels were identified and masked \nbased on the criteria of Rrc(865) >0.25 and Rrc(560) >0.25 (Qi et al., \n2014 ). Algal scum pixels were detected using the floating algae index \n(FAI) proposed by Hu (2009) , which was calculated based on the Rrc at \n665, 865, and 1020 nm bands. Following the method of Hu et al. (2010) , \na time-independent threshold FAI =1.194 \u00d710\u00004 was adopted to mask \nalgal scum pixels. Aquatic vegetation can also be masked with this \nthreshold. After data quality control and preprocessing, each lake had an \naverage of 7 \u00b12 available images covered with few clouds per month \n(Fig. 3). The number of available images is relatively small due to the \nrainy weather in summer. \n2.4. Model development and selection \nField data samples and satellite data were matched based on \ngeographic coordinates within a time difference of \u00b13 h. A total of 248 \npairs of matchups were obtained. The distribution of the main param -\neters in the matchups is consistent with the distribution of the total field \ndataset (Fig. S1 g-i), indicating that the matchup dataset is representa -\ntive. Accordingly, 60% (N =150) of matchups were divided based on the \nconcentration gradient and used as the model calibration set (CAL). The \nremaining 98 matchups were used as the model validation set (VAL). \nSatellite-derived independent variables were used in model develop -\nment in order to cancel uncertainties in satellite products as much as \npossible through regression coefficients. Before model development, \nindependent variables with skewed distributions (skewness >2.0 and \nmin/max ratio <0.1) were log-transformed to comply with the model \u2019s \nnormality assumption. In our dataset, Chl-a and ZSD needed to be log- \ntransformed. In addition, independent variables were standardized to \nsuppress the correlation between each other. \nIn a previous study, a combination of Chl-a, Tw, Kd, and AccuPAR \ncould accurately estimate cCO2 in an eutrophic lake (Qi et al., 2020 ). In \nour dataset, cCO2 was also significantly correlated with ln(Chl- a), Tw, ln \n(ZSD), and AccuPAR (p <0.05), and Kd were highly correlated with ZSD \n(Zhang et al., 2020 ). Thus, a stepwise quadratic polynomial regression \nmodel was trained using ln(Chl- a), Tw, ln(ZSD), and AccuPAR as inde-\npendent variables (referred to in this research as Model1). \nConsidering that AccuPAR may ignore the differences in received \nradiation between samples observed at different times in one field sur-\nvey, time-related variables were added to improve model performance. \nThe Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to compare the good-\nness of fit between candidate models. The degree of interpretation of \ncCO2 variations by each model was compared by the coefficient of \ndetermination (R2). First, AccuPAR was replaced by instantaneous PAR \nvariables (iPAR and aPAR). But the model performance did not improve (Table S1). Then we tested other combinations of these PAR-related \nvariables. Only the combination of AccuPAR and iPAR improved AIC \nand R2 (Table S1). The corresponding quadratic polynomial model ob-\ntained after stepwise regression was referred to as Model2. Based on \nModel2, other time-related variables (Ts, Drs, ks) were added to \nstrengthen the estimation ability of samples observed at different times \nfor a variety of targeted lakes. Since the AIC and R2 of models were all \nimproved after adding these variables (Table S1), these three models \nremained as candidate models, referred to as Model3, Model 4, and \nModel5. Model3 (Drs) emphasizes the time to receive solar radiation. \nModel4 (Ts) emphasizes the absolute moment of observation. Model5 \n(ks) focuses on characterizing the amount of radiation accumulated at \nthe moment of observation. Furthermore, the candidate models were \nevaluated by the estimation accuracy of the calibration and validation \nsets. The final cCO2 estimation model was decided based on compre -\nhensive comparisons of the model \u2019s goodness of fit, degree of interpre -\ntation, and model performance. All models were constructed using the R \nv.4.0.5 (R is a language, and it is used in an environment for statistical \ncomputing, provided by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, \nVienna, Austria; URL https://www.R-project.org/ ). \n2.5. Model sensitivity analysis \nMonte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the model \u2019s sensitivity \nto input variables \u2019 uncertainties. Uncertainties in each satellite-derived \ninput variable were quantified based on the mean absolute relative error \n(MAPE ). The max MAPE of Chl-a was 36.91% in (Shen et al., 2022 ). The \nmax MAPE of ZSD was 33.43% in (Shen et al., 2020 ). The MAPE of the Tw \nproduct was 5.20% (Fig. S3 d). The max MAPE of the PAR product was \n9.04% (Fig. S3 b, c). Considering these MAPE from published literature \nor the evaluation results of our dataset, conservative larger uncertainties \nof 40%, 10%, 40%, and 20% were defined for the satellite derived Chl-a, \nTw, ZSD, and iPAR data, respectively. For each combination of input \nuncertainties, the Monte Carlo simulation ran 100,000 iterations for \nevery 248 field-satellite matchups. For simulated variables <0 after the \nerror was assigned, the simulations were reassigned to ensure the \ncalculation of the model (Chl-a, 1; Tw, 1; ZSD, 0.01; iPAR, 100). Since \nAccuPAR was obtained by integrating the daily iPAR, we did not \nsimulate its uncertainty separately but directly transferred the iPAR \nerrors to it. The averaged results ranged from 5th to 95th based on \n100,000 simulation results used as the final simulation result to reduce \nthe effect of extreme outliers on the simulation results. Statistics on the \ndifferences between the simulation results and original model outputs of \nall matchups were used to quantitatively evaluate the model \u2019s sensi-\ntivity to the uncertainties of different input variables. \n2.6. Statistical analysis and accuracy assessment \nStandard statistical metrics were used to quantify the accuracy of the \nestimated dissolved CO2 concentrations of different models and the \ndifferences between the simulation results and original model outputs. \nThe coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE ), \nmean absolute relative error (MAPE ), mean bias (MB), mean ratio (MR), \nand mean relative difference (MRD) were included.

Selection of cCO 2 estimation model \nOf all the five candidate models, Model3 with the input combination \nof Chl-a, ZSD, Tw, iPAR, AccuPAR, and Drs showed the best overall \nperformance (Table 2). Compared with Model1, in which variables \nrelated to observation time were omitted, other models had improved \ngoodness of fit and degree of interpretation. At the same time, the \ncomplexity of the models also significantly increased with Model5 \nhaving 20 equation terms, which is about twice as many as that found in \nthe first three models. However, the model estimation accuracy for the \ncalibration set did not significantly improve with the increase in vari-\nables. RMSE and MAPE of Model2 \u20135 had an improvement rating below \n15% compared to Model1. For the validation set, the estimation accu-\nracy of Model4 and Moldel5 decreased, indicating overfitting. Although \nthe estimation accuracy of models for the overall validation set did not \ndrop significantly compared to the calibration set, the model perfor -\nmance for validation samples in different seasons decreased with the \nlowest degree of interpretation recorded in the spring and winter (R2 <\n0.5, Table 2). The RMSE of Model1 for the spring validation samples increased by 40% compared to the overall validation set. The perfor -\nmance of Model2 and Model5 for summer samples also increased by \nover 30%. Only the RMSE of Model3 and Model4 increased <25% for \neach seasonal sample. For the winter validation samples, only the R2 of \nModel2 and Model3 is still 0.38. In summary, the performance of \nModel3 for the calibration set and the validation set was the best among \nthe five models (R2 >0.38, RMSE <6.35 \u03bcmol L\u00001, MAPE <25.32%). \nThe validation performance of Model3 for each season was also better \nthan other five models. Combined with its performance in the AIC value \nand the number of equation terms, Model 3 was selected as the cCO2 \nestimation model for lakes in the ML_YHR basins. The model \u2019s specific \ncoefficients and statistical information are shown in Table S2. \n3.2. Model performance \n3.2.1. Performance for field surveys \nFor field-satellite matchups, the model-estimated cCO2 showed good \nagreement with field-measured cCO2. They were distributed on both \nsides of the 1:1 line (R2 \u22480.7, RMSE <6.34 \u03bcmol L\u00001, and MAPE <\n24.68% in Fig. 4). Model estimates showed a slight underestimation for \nsamples with cCO2 larger than 30 \u03bcmol L\u00001. The mean daily cCO2 of \nsamples from one sampling campaign in one lake (matched within one \nday) also showed good consistency (R2 \u22480.75, RMSE <4.32 \u03bcmol L\u00001, \nMAPE <31.10%, Fig. 4 b). Relative bias for surveys with low cCO2 (<\n10 \u03bcmol L\u00001) were large because the average of limited samples was \nsusceptible to outliers. For matchup samples from lakes in different \ntrophic states (mesotrophic to highly eutrophic), model estimates also \nshowed good performance (R2 >0.64, RMSE <6.85 \u03bcmol L\u00001, MAPE <\n26.57%, Table S3). \nEstimated spatial cCO2 variations also agreed with the measured \ndata and prior knowledge (Fig. 5). For lake estuary areas, our model \nestimated a lower cCO2 than other areas because of the lower Chl-a and \nSecchi disk depth (ZSD) resulting from river inflows (Fig. 5 Lake Hongze \nand Gaoyou). Surface cCO2 in shallow lakes would also elevate due to \nthe vertical exchange of CO2-rich bottom water with sediment resus -\npension resulting from wind and wave disturbance in southeastern Lake \nTable 2 \nStatistical metrics of five candidate models for calibration and validation datasets.  \nDatasets Numbers Statistic Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 \nCalibration 150 Model Input Chl-a, Tw, \nZSD, \nAccuPAR Chl-a, Tw, ZSD, \nAccuPAR, iPAR Chl-a, Tw, ZSD, AccuPAR, \niPAR, Drs Chl-a, Tw, ZSD, AccuPAR, \niPAR, Ts Chl-a, Tw, ZSD, AccuPAR, \niPAR, ks \nAIC \u0000310.10 \u0000320.66 \u00a1330.68 \u0000338.93 \u0000346.60 \nNumber of \nterms 8.00 9.00 12.00 17.00 20.00 \nR2 0.67 0.70 0.73 0.75 0.76 \nRMSE 7.02 6.64 6.35 5.86 6.10 \nMAPE 26.85 25.26 24.68 23.32 23.77 \nMR 1.06 1.05 1.05 1.04 1.04 \nValidation Spring 15 RMSE 8.28 6.97 5.94 6.89 7.58 \nMAPE 25.97 19.70 18.81 21.92 22.61 \nMR 0.95 0.92 0.95 0.95 0.92 \nR2 \u00000.16 0.18 0.41 0.20 0.03 \nSummer 8 RMSE 5.08 6.76 4.26 4.46 5.48 \nMAPE 29.97 34.31 25.32 23.94 42.30 \nMR 1.07 1.03 1.09 1.04 1.23 \nR2 0.85 0.74 0.90 0.89 0.83 \nAutumn \n35 RMSE 3.37 4.60 3.04 4.04 6.30 \nMAPE 21.65 23.68 17.08 15.92 23.68 \nMR 0.95 0.95 1.00 1.00 0.96 \nR2 0.83 0.68 0.86 0.76 0.40 \nWinter 40 RMSE 6.65 5.99 5.95 7.55 8.46 \nMAPE 24.24 25.31 23.78 29.69 32.51 \nMR 1.01 1.06 1.05 1.02 0.91 \nR2 0.23 0.38 0.38 0.01 \u00000.24 \nAll 98 RMSE 5.89 5.78 4.96 6.17 7.39 \nMAPE 24.05 24.60 20.75 23.11 28.64 \nMR 0.99 1.00 1.02 1.00 0.96 \nR2 0.61 0.63 0.72 0.58 0.39  T. Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n8Taihu (Fig. 5). However, Low ZSD areas with high Chl-a would have \nrevealed a low cCO2 due to the increasing photosynthesis intensity with \nincreasing Chl-a in the northwestern bay of Lake Taihu (Fig. 5). Simi-\nlarly, low Chl-a areas with high ZSD would also have low cCO2, because \nthe depth-integrated primary production related to both Chl-a and ZSD, \nwhich also increased with the increasing ZSD (Behrenfeld and Falkowski, \n1997 ) (in the northeastern bay of Lake Taihu (Fig. 5). Moreover, the \nphotosynthesis intensity may be weaker than respiration under low- \ntemperature conditions during the winter months. Thus, higher cCO2 \nwould occur in areas with high Chl-a in winter (western Lake Chaohu, \nsoutheastern Lake Liangzi, Fig. 5). Our model worked well in these \ncomplex situations and displayed reasonable spatial patterns of cCO2. \nWe also used the same matchup dataset to recalibrate the model \ncoefficients of the cCO2 estimation model proposed by Qi et al. (2020) \nfor Lake Taihu (Taihu model). The input variables for the Taihu model \nwere Chl-a, Tw, Kd (PAR), and AccuPAR. The Kd (PAR) in this study was \nconverted from ZSD using the relationship proposed by Zhang et al. \n(2020) where Kd (PAR) =1.434 ZSD \u00000.982, while R2 =0.935 and p <\n0.001. The performance of the Taihu model was significantly lower than \nour model (R2 \u22480.35, RMSE \u22489.6 \u03bcmol L\u00001, MAPE \u224843%, Fig. 4 c), \nwith a considerable overestimation for low cCO2 matchups (<5 \u03bcmol \nL\u00001). The Taihu model also failed to estimate matchups with high cCO2 \n(>20 \u03bcmol L\u00001). Moreover, the mean daily cCO2 of samples from one \nfield survey (matched within one day) had large biases where RMSE \u2248\n8.61 \u03bcmol L\u00001, and MAPE \u224843.92% (Fig. 4 d), with a low and insig-\nnificant degree of interpretation for the variations of cCO2 (R2 <0.2 and \np >0.05). The Taihu model also estimated incorrect cCO2 spatial pat-\nterns in most sampled lakes compared with field data and our model \n(Fig. 5). Comparing the recalibrated Taihu model proved the limitations \nof the local trained model and advantages of our regional trained model. 3.2.2. Comparison between Sentinel-3 and Aqua MODIS in Lake Taihu \nCompared with the multi-year spatiotemporal variation of cCO2 in \nLake Taihu from 2016 to 2020 estimated by Aqua MODIS data using the \nmodel proposed by Qi et al. (2020) (Fig. 6 a, b), the results of our model \nwere consistent but with lower estimates. Sentinel-3-derived cCO2 \nshowed more details in places like the northwestern small bay and the \nsouthwestern river mouth due to better spatial resolution of OLCI. Lower \nestimates mainly occurred in the southwestern areas during winter and \nspring according to the time series of four virtual stations (Fig. 6 f). \nThese spatial differences between the two estimates may be due to the \ndifferences in observation times and uncertainties of satellite products. \nThe time difference between Sentinel-3 and Aqua observations is about \n3 h. This will lead to differences in the spatial patterns of water quality in \nLake Taihu (Qi et al., 2018 ; Chen et al., 2019b ), resulting in different \ncCO2 patterns. On the other hand, the lack of a critical band at 665 nm in \nthe case of MODIS would lead to uncertainties in long-term MODIS Chl-a \nretrieval (Cao et al., 2022b ; Shen et al., 2022 ). Uncertainties of Aqua- \nderived Chl-a products (R2 =0.75, MAPE =25.3%, RMSE =10.6 \u03bcg \nL\u00001 (Shi et al., 2015a )) could lead to overestimations (Qi et al., 2020 ). \nThe lower Chl-a in the southwestern area may also lead to a larger un-\ncertainty of Chl-a products, exacerbating the differences between the \nestimates of Aqua and Sentinel-3. Nevertheless, matchups in the four \nvirtual stations of two estimates showed that although there were dif-\nferences in RMSE =28.22 \u03bcmol L\u00001 and MAPE =46.72%, the overall \nconsistency was good (MR =1.03). These calculations proved that our \nmodel can reflect the multi-year cCO2 variations of a specific lake to \nensure the accuracy of cCO2 estimations in regional lakes. \n3.2.3.

Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n9showed that the given uncertainties of a single input variable had minor \neffects on model estimations, and the model could output stable and \nreliable results (Fig. 7, Table S4). The model was most sensitive to \nchanges in ZSD. The relative error of 40% ZSD could cause a 21.22% bias, \nwhile the estimated bias caused by the relative error of 30% ZSD was \nreduced by about 35% to only 13.67%. However, it was still slightly \nhigher than the estimated bias caused by other input variables under \nsimilar relative errors. Similarly, the estimated bias caused by the relative errors of PAR also increased by about 42% (to 15.59%) when the \nrelative error increased from 15% to 20%. The influence of Chl-a and Tw \non the estimation results did not change significantly with the increase \nof the relative errors, which were about 11%. The simulation results \nshowed that the uncertainty of ZSD can lead to overestimation of the \nmodel results (MR =1.15), especially when ZSD is <0.3 m, as shown in \nFig. 7 (c). The uncertainty of PAR when >50 Einstein m\u00002 d\u00001 would \nlead to an underestimation (MR =0.86), as shown in Fig. 7 (d). \nFig. 5.Spatial pattern comparison of cCO2 estimation models. The first column shows RGB images obtained from Sentinel-3 OLCI. The second and third columns \nshow satellite-derived Chl-a and ZSD, respectively. The fourth and fifth columns show satellite-estimated images of cCO2 based on our model and Qi et al. (2020) \nmodel, respectively. T. Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n10After considering the uncertainties of all input variables, the esti-\nmated bias of the model was still <25%, within the uncertainty of the \nmodel itself (Table S4). ZSD was still the input variable with the most \nsignificant impact on the estimation results. Simulation results with \nlarge bias are mainly those with a ZSD of <0.3 m as shown in Fig. 7 (e-h). \nNotably, the number of simulation results with high bias was reduced \nwhen the uncertainties of all variables were considered together, as \nopposed to considering the uncertainty of a single variable. Considering the lower MAPE of ZSD evaluated by Shen et al. (2020) and our field data \nat <33.43% and PAR products at ~10% shown in Fig.S2 (b) and Fig. S3 \n(b, c), the actual estimated bias caused by the uncertainties of input \nvariables may be similar to the results shown in Fig. 7 (e), which is \n<20% and distributed on both sides of the 1:1 line. In addition, quality \ncontrol during the generation of multi-year series data and the removal \nof extreme outliers can also ensure the reliability of the obtained multi- \nyear cCO2 dataset. \nFig. 6.Monthly spatial variation of cCO2 estimated by (a) our model using Sentinel-3 data and by (b) Qi et al.

Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n113.3. Spatiotemporal variations in the cCO 2 of lakes in the ML_YHR basins \nThe satellite-estimated annual mean cCO2 of 113 lakes with an area \nof >10 km2 in the ML_YHR basins from 2016 to 2021 was 18.01 \u00b12.64 \n\u03bcmol L\u00001, showing a weak difference between lakes (CV: 14.66%) \n(Fig. 8). After converting cCO2 into partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), the \nannual mean pCO2 was 402 \u00b1154 \u03bcatm, which was close to the atmo -\nspheric CO2 partial pressure (400 \u03bcatm). The annual mean cCO2 in the \nlakes of the Huai River Basin (21.04 \u00b11.93 \u03bcmol L\u00001 where N =24) was \nabout 18% higher than that of the lakes in the middle and lower reaches \nof the Yangtze River (17.20 \u00b12.17 \u03bcmol L\u00001 where N =89). \nOverall, the satellite-estimated cCO2 of lakes in the ML_YHR basins \nalso showed dramatic seasonal variations as shown in Fig. 8 (d, e), with a \nmean variation coefficient of the monthly mean cCO2 as high as 52.59%. \nEven though classified according to different criteria, the monthly mean \ncCO2 of the whole lake showed a seasonal variation pattern that was low \nin summer and autumn and high in winter and spring, indicating that the \nseasonal variation of algae mainly controls the seasonal variation of the \nlake cCO2 in the ML_YHR basins. The cCO2 of eutrophic lakes was higher \nthan that of the mesotrophic lakes in the winter months but lower than \nthat of mesotrophic lakes during other seasons. At the same time, this \ndifference would increase with the degree of eutrophication. Specif -\nically, in the summer and autumn months, the estuary areas of lakes \nshowed extremely high values of the cCO2, while the more eutrophic \nareas showed extremely low values of cCO2 as shown in Fig. 9 (b, c). \nConversely, the more eutrophic areas of lakes in spring and winter \nshowed relatively high cCO2 values, while the estuary areas had rela-\ntively low cCO2 values as shown in Fig. 9 (a, d). \nSpecifically, satellite-estimated spatial cCO2 variations for large \nlakes (>100 km2) with different trophic states showed dramatic but reasonable heterogeneity (Fig. 10). Satellite estimates showed high cCO2 \nnear the channel or estuary of rivers in lakes with a high river \u2013lake \nconnectivity, such as Lake Poyang, Lake Dongting, and Lake Hongze, as \nshown in Fig. 10 (a, c, d). It was consistent with previous studies where \ninputs of CO2-rich river water would raise the lake\u2019s cCO2 (Wey-\nhenmeyer et al., 2015 ). The medium eutrophic such as Lake Luoma and \nJunshan in Fig. 10 (e, f) were similar to the highly eutrophic northern \nbay of Lake Taihu in Fig. 7 (g) and the Western Lake Chaohu in Fig. 10 \n(h), showing strong seasonal variations (CV about 50%). For Lake Taihu, \nas is shown in Fig. 10 (g), satellite estimates reflected spatial differen -\ntiation of high cCO2 in the northern lake bay and low cCO2 in the middle \nand southern lake areas; This is consistent with long-term field moni -\ntoring (Xiao et al., 2020 ). Satellite-estimated cCO2 in the high Chl-a \nnorthern area was lower in summer and autumn and higher in winter \nand spring compared with Lake Taihu \u2019s low Chl-a central area as shown \nin Fig. 10 (g). Satellite-estimated cCO2 in Lake Chaohu also showed a \nsimilar seasonal variation between higher Chl-a western and lower Chl-a \nin the eastern area in Fig. 10 (h). Furthermore, the satellite-estimated \nannual mean cCO2 for Lake Chaohu was 21.27 \u03bcmol L\u00001 (range: \n12.00 \u201337.33 \u03bcmol L\u00001), which was consistent with the field sampling \nresults in the four quarters in 2017 with a range of 13.31 \u201355.47 \u03bcmol \nL\u00001, and an annual mean of 26.27 \u03bcmol L\u00001 (Qi et al., 2019 ). The \nspatiotemporal variations of cCO2 in lakes with different trophic states \nestimated by satellite data were in line with prior knowledge and reports \nfrom previous studies, indicating that the results were reliable for \nreconstructing the spatial and temporal variations of cCO2 in ML_YHR \nlakes. \nWhen divided into four classes according to trophic states, it was \nfound that the annual mean cCO2 of lakes significantly decreased in \ndifferent classes with the increased eutrophication degree (R2 =0.96, p \nFig. 8.Spatiotemporal variations of satellite-estimated cCO2 from 2016 to 2021 for lakes larger than 10 km2 in the study area.

Among them, 49% of the 47 highly \neutrophic lakes had an annual mean cCO2 lower than the concentration \nof CO2 atmospheric equilibrium, which tended to be weak atmospheric \nCO2 sinks. Moreover, 26% of the 19 medium eutrophic lakes have an \nannual mean cCO2 lower than the concentration of CO2 atmospheric \nequilibrium. In the remaining 47 light eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes, \nonly 9% of the lakes had an annual mean cCO2 lower than the concen -\ntration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium. For the monthly mean cCO2 \nvariations shown in Fig. 8 (d), as the degree of eutrophication increased, \nand the duration of the lake cCO2 lasted longer below the concentration \nof CO2 atmospheric equilibrium. The monthly cCO2 in the mesotrophic \nlakes were slightly lower than the concentration of CO2 atmospheric \nequilibrium in June, July, August, and November (summer and \nautumn), while the monthly cCO2 in highly eutrophic lakes could last for \nnearly half a year (May to November). In addition, the cCO2 of meso -\ntrophic lakes were lower than that of eutrophic lakes in the winter \nmonths, and the decreasing trend and magnitude of cCO2 in mesotrophic \nlakes in the spring were also lower than those of eutrophic lakes. \nWhen divided into four classes according to lake sizes, it was found \nthat the annual mean cCO2 of lakes in different classes significantly \nincreased with the increase of the lake size (R2 =0.97 and p <0.01), as \nshown in Fig. 11 (c, d). The mean cCO2 of large lakes (>500 km2) was \nabout 25% higher than those of small lakes (10\u201350 km2). Among them, only one of the 26 lakes above 100 km2 had an annual mean cCO2 lower \nthan the concentration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium. In contrast, 37 \nof the 87 (43%) lakes below 100 km2 have an annual mean cCO2 lower \nthan the concentration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium. Considering \neutrophic lakes account for the majority of both lake sizes (>100 km2 at \n66% and <100 km2 at 88%). Lake size seemed to be a factor that could \nsignificantly affect lake cCO2 levels in addition to trophic states. \n4.Discussion \n4.1. Why does our model work? \nThe production and consumption processes of dissolved CO2 in lake \nsurface water are mainly divided into endogenous and exogenous pro-\ncesses as shown in Fig. 12. These factors and processes mainly includes: \n(a) the direct input of carbon (mainly DIC and DOC) from the river and \nland to the lake (Weyhenmeyer et al., 2015 ), (b) the balance of CO2 and \nother DIC species in the carbonate system (Marc \u00b4e et al., 2015 ; Stets et al., \n2017 ), (c) the photochemical and microbial mineralization of dissolved \norganic matter in the water body, which produces CO2 (Tranvik et al., \n2009 ; Nydahl et al., 2019 ), (d) the mineralization of sediments that \nproduce CO2 and exchange it from the bottom to surface through up-\nwelling (Ducharme-Riel et al., 2015 ; Reed et al., 2018 ), (e) the \nFig. 9.Satellite-estimated seasonal variation of cCO2 for lakes larger than 10 km2 in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River ba-\nsins, China.

When coupled with each other, they \nwill jointly affect the spatial and temporal dynamics of the lake CO2. \nChl-a is an indicator of phytoplankton biomass in lakes. Under suitable \nconditions of temperature, light and ZSD, the increase of Chl-a will in-\ncrease the consumption of CO2 in photosynthesis, resulting in decreased \ncCO2 (Behrenfeld and Falkowski, 1997 ; Balmer and Downing, 2011 ). On \nthe other hand, environmental conditions, such as low temperatures in \nwinter, insufficient PAR, or underwater weak light conditions caused by \nlow ZSD would not be conducive to photosynthesis.

Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n15conditions, the biological respiration and metabolic intensity would be \ngreater than the photosynthesis intensity, resulting in a higher cCO2 \n(Kortelainen et al., 2006 ; Kosten et al., 2010 ; Marotta et al., 2014 ). In \nour cCO2 estimation model (Table S2), the previously mentioned effects \nof Chl-a on cCO2 were jointly constrained by Tw and ZSD through \nquadratic polynomial regression. The sensitivity analysis showed that \nZSD was the most sensitive parameter in lakes tested (Table S4), which \nwas different with the Taihu model where Chl-a was the most sensitive \n(Qi et al., 2020 ). It indicated that the effect of ZSD on photosynthesis in \nother less eutrophic lakes was greater than Chl-a, which was different \nfrom the highly eutrophic Lake Taihu. \nSimilarly, in addition to being an indicator of the underwater light \ncondition associated with algal photosynthesis (Deng et al., 2017 ; Qi \net al., 2020 ), Secchi disk depth (ZSD) also has the potential to predict the \nphysical mixing related to changes in cCO2 because the resuspensions of \nsediments are susceptible to water mixing in shallow lakes. Most of the \nlakes in the ML_YHR basins are shallow lakes (mean depth: 1.1\u20138.4 m), \nand the suspended particulate matter in lakes varies sharply (1\u2013300 mg \nL\u00001) and is susceptible to resuspension events caused by hydrodynamic \ndisturbances (Hou et al., 2017 ; Cao et al., 2020 ). Disturbances caused by \nriver inputs and vertical mixing of lake water can significantly affect the \ndynamics of lake suspended matter, affecting ZSD (Liu et al., 2020 ; Shen \net al., 2020 ). Both of these processes would increase surface cCO2 \n(Marotta et al., 2014 ; Podgrajsek et al., 2015 ; Weyhenmeyer et al., \n2015 ), making ZSD an indicator of cCO2. Water temperature could \nsignificantly affect various biogeochemical processes in water bodies \nand is a recognized predictor of CO2 (Sobek et al., 2005 ; Marotta et al., \n2009 ; Kosten et al., 2010 ). In the estimated model (Table S2), Tw \ninteracted with PAR and ZSD in addition to Chl-a, confirming its inter-\naction with various biogeochemical processes in the lake. \nDOC quality changing with trophic states makes DOC an unstable \npredictor of cCO2 in lakes. DOC in lakes mainly originate from exoge -\nnous (e.g., terrestrial inputs) and endogenous (e.g., phytoplankton) \nsources (Fig. 12). The exogenous DOC has been shown to be more \nbioactive and easier to be mineralized to CO2 (Weyhenmeyer et al., \n2012 ; K\u00a8ohler et al., 2013 ). In boreal forest lakes or low-productivity \nlakes, where exogenous DOC from terrestrial inputs dominates, DOC \nand CDOM were good indicators of lake CO2 (Sobek et al., 2005 ; Ray-\nmond et al., 2013 ; Klaus et al., 2019 ). The eutrophication would make \nrefractory endogenous DOC contribute more to the total DOC pool \n(Kothawala et al., 2014 ; Wen et al., 2022 ), weakening the relationship \nbetween DOC and cCO2 in lakes. The relationship between DOC and CO2 \nin China lakes was found insignificant in both a previous study (Wen \net al., 2017 ) and our measured data (Fig. S4 and p >0.05). In the context \nof increasing global lake eutrophication (Wang et al., 2018 ; Hou et al., \n2022 ), selecting the more derivable indicators such as Chl-a or ZSD as \ninput variables would be more beneficial for the cCO2 estimation model \nfor regional lakes when satellite-derived DOC or CDOM products are not \navailable (Kutser et al., 2015 ). Since indicators of organic matter com-\nponents and lake trophic states are usually optical active (e.g., CDOM \nabsorption spectral indexes, CDOM fluorescence indexes) (Zhang et al., \n2017 ; Wen et al., 2022 ). It might be great help to develop remote sensing \nmethods that allow lake classification into exogenous and endogenous \nclasses and then choose appropriate algorithms for deriving cCO2 from \nspace. \n4.2. Improvements and limitations \nAlthough our model has good overall performance, limitations still \nexist in some cases. Our model could explain about 70% of the variance \nof cCO2 with MAPE <25% for calibration and validation datasets (Fig. 4, \nTable 2). The remaining 30% of the unexplained variance may come \nfrom the inorganic carbon input of rivers, the CO2 production rate in \nsediments, and the decomposition rate of organic matter (Weyhenmeyer \net al., 2015 ). Although we hypothesize that ZSD can indirectly indicate \nthe effects of mixing between surface water and CO2-rich bottom water or river water, such complex hydrological processes may not be fully \npredicted by quadratic equations alone. In addition, the estimation ac-\ncuracy of our model decreases in winter and spring, with an R2 of only \nabout 0.4. This may be because photosynthesis of algae has less impact \non CO2 during periods of dormancy and germination of algae, resulting \nin a reduced degree of model interpretation of CO2 variation in these \nseasons. The model sensitivity analysis results showed that the model \nwas most sensitive to the uncertainty of ZSD (Table S4), especially for a \nZSD <0.3 m (Fig. 7). This suggested that the model may overfit the high \ncCO2 in a low ZSD case during calibration, which in turn leads to over-\nestimated cCO2. Nevertheless, when comprehensively considering the \nuncertainties of all input variables, the relative deviation of the model \u2019s \nestimates was <25%, and the relative deviation was only 15.98% under \nthe ideal accuracy of the input variable (Table S4), where no extreme \nabnormality has occurred. Based on the sensitivity analysis and statis -\ntical metrics of the model calibration and validation results (Table 2), \nthe estimated results of the model in this study could reflect reliable \nspatiotemporal variations of cCO2, with a small uncertainty of about \n25%, which is only half of the mean coefficient of variation of monthly \ncCO2. \nAdding time-related auxiliary variables to the model could also help \nimprove the model performance, in addition to satellite-derived vari-\nables. In previous studies, the time differences between sampling sites \nover a single field survey was usually ignored, and each sampling site \nwas used to represent lake cCO2 spatial variations. However, lake cCO2 \ncan vary dramatically on an hourly scale (Morales-Pineda et al., 2014 ; \nXu et al., 2019 ; Qi et al., 2020 ). Ignoring the temporal differences be-\ntween sampling sites can be misleading as the assumption is that the \ndifferences in cCO2 between sites consists only of spatial differences, \nwhich may hinder the development of the estimation model. For single \nlake studies, scheduled periodic sampling could mitigate this bias to a \ncertain extent (Xiao et al., 2020 ; Yan et al., 2021 ) and enable developing \nof higher-accuracy models (Qi et al., 2020 ). However, in regional or \nglobal studies, it is difficult to confirm the exact observation times of \nsampling sites in different surveys. Thus, time-related deviations in \nsamples may reduce the interpretation of critical cCO2 predictors, hin-\ndering the development of high-performance models. In this study, \nadding time-related variables improved the model \u2019s AIC, R2, and RMSE \nperformance in the calibration processes (Table 2). The model perfor -\nmance for validation samples also significantly improved, with an \noverall RMSE reduction of 17% and a 28% for the spring samples. These \nresults show that the addition of time-related variables is of great help to \nthe development of an cCO2 estimation model for regional lakes. \nMoreover, it also proved that the time differences between sampling \nsites have a non-negligible effect on analyzing the spatial and temporal \nvariation of the CO2 in the regional lakes. \nIn the field-satellite matchup dataset used for model calibration and \nvalidation in this study, the Chl-a level was mesotrophic or eutrophic \n(26.97 \u00b121.34 \u03bcg L\u00001), while ZSD was at a low level compared with \nglobal lakes (0.36 \u00b10.18 m, with a conservative global estimate of 1.88 \n\u00b11.24 m (He et al., 2022 )). Therefore, the model in this study is theo-\nretically applicable to eutrophic turbid lakes. For low-productivity lakes, \nthe related biological processes affecting cCO2 are not dominated by \nalgae. This type of lakes mainly act as the decomposition place of \nterrestrial organic matter, resulting in a better relationship between \ncCO2 and DOC and CDOM (Sobek et al., 2003 ). For deep-water lakes \nwith a relatively steady mixing regime (Woolway and Merchant, 2019 ), \nit is difficult for sediment resuspension to occur, making the ZSD unable \nto predict CO2 variations resulting from vertical mixing. For saline lakes, \nthe carbonate balance controlled by physical and chemical parameters \nsuch as water temperature and salinity may have more significant im-\npacts on cCO2 (Li et al., 2021 ), making the input variables of our model \ninsufficient for predicting this process. Therefore, the basic assumptions \nof our model do not apply to the types of lakes mentioned in this \nparagraph, which can hinder the direct application of the model on a \nglobal scale. T. Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n16In addition to the uncertainty of the cCO2 estimation model itself, \nsome potential cCO2 dynamics that optical remote sensing could not \ncapture raised the uncertainty in the estimation of lake cCO2. For \nexample, because optical sensors cannot acquire water-leaving infor-\nmation under cloud cover, short-term and intense CO2 variations \naccompanying the clouds or precipitation would be missing (Ojala et al., \n2011 ). Similarly, optical sensors cannot acquire water-leaving infor-\nmation under algal scums and aquatic vegetation, where potentially \nmore dramatic dynamics in cCO2 have been reported (Bolpagni et al., \n2007 ; Ouyang et al., 2017 ). Algae and macrophytes have intense \nphotosynthesis and consume lots of CO2 during their growth and \ndevelopment, while their residues decay and decompose thereby pro-\nducing a large amount of CO2 after they die. However, due to the \nshading or interference of algal scums and macrophytes to the acquisi -\ntion of radiative information on lake water, it is difficult to derive the \nlake environment parameters correctly, which brings challenges to the \nremote sensing estimation of cCO2 in these areas. In this study, only \nabout 10% of the pixels were masked as algal scums and macrophytes \nwith a high frequency (>20%, Fig. S5). This indicates that the \nremaining 90% pixels represent the opportunity to evaluate cCO2 dy-\nnamics in ML_YHR lakes. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to develop \nnew approaches to remotely estimate cCO2 in these masked areas to \nadvance knowledge of lake CO2 dynamics in further research. \n4.3. Opportunities and challenges \nThere may be dramatic spatiotemporal variations of lake cCO2 be-\ntween lakes and within lakes (Fig. 9), which is hard to monitor through \ntraditional discrete and low-frequency field samplings. The lack of suf-\nficient spatiotemporal coverage on global lakes has been an essential \nsource of uncertainties in previous estimates of global lake CO2 emis-\nsions (Raymond et al., 2013 ; Holgerson and Raymond, 2016 ). For the \n113 study lakes in the ML_YHR basins, a relative deviation of about 35% \nin the estimated mean value of cCO2 could occur if only one lake was \nselected to represent the entire number of regional lakes. Further \nconsideration of cCO2 seasonal variations could cause the range of the \nestimated mean cCO2 to be close to three times the reference regional \nmean value (mean relative deviation: 61%, range: \u000091% to 186%), with \nsignificant uncertainties. Although there was a relative uncertainty of \n25% in the results based on our satellite estimation model, it was only \nabout half of the mean potential uncertainty in the field-based estimates. \nThe remote sensing approach has great potential in reducing un-\ncertainties of monitoring and evaluating CO2 emissions from regional or \nglobal lakes. \nSatellite remote sensing is one of the few approaches to monitoring \nhighly heterogeneous regional or global lake CO2 dynamics at a rela-\ntively low cost. It is difficult to eliminate the time difference between \nsampling sites during field sampling, and differences in CO2 between \nsampling sites often result from both temporal and spatial differences. \nEven for automated navigation samplings conducted by unmanned \nboats, three hours were needed to monitor a lake of about 40 km2 (Loken \net al., 2019 ). The high-frequency lake CO2 emissions monitoring \nnetwork could only obtain a rough overview of spatial patterns repre -\nsenting lake CO2 emissions; however, this overview came with high \nconstruction and maintenance costs (Lee et al., 2014 ). In contrast, sat-\nellite imaging time for large areas is instantaneous compared to field \nsampling. The average cost of satellite data is low because massive \nglobal data can be obtained after the launch. This study proved that \nadding time-related variables to the estimation model could mitigate the \ncoupling of temporal differences in the field cCO2 data, which enabled \nthe acquisition of a more realistic spatial variation of lake cCO2. In \nfurther research, more field-satellite matched data from multi-type lakes \nshould be obtained with within a time difference less than three hours. \nOther satellite sensors, besides Sentinel-3 OLCI, have the potential to \ninvestigate lake CO2 emissions. For example, the Aqua MODIS data time \nseries is over 20 years long. However, it is challenging to quantify pigments like Chl-a in inland waters because MODIS does not have \nspectral bands in the red part of the spectrum, which is critical to \ndetecting Chl-a in inland and coastal waters (Cao et al., 2022b ). The \nLandsat series data can extend the observation to 1984 (nearly 40 years). \nIts high spatial resolution (30 m) is suitable for monitoring small lakes \n(1\u201310 km2), which cannot be mapped with moderate resolution sensors \n(e.g., MODIS, OLCI) (Palmer et al., 2015 ). However, the 8-bit radio -\nmetric resolution of sensors before Landsat-8 is not sufficient for map-\nping water quality parameters (Kutser, 2012 ). Moreover, considering \nthe cloud cover, the longer revisit period of high-resolution satellites (e. \ng., Landsat ~16 days) does not allow data acquisition at a sufficient \nfrequency (Klaus et al., 2019 ). However, Sentinel-2 allows lake sampling \nwith a 5-day revisit time (with a shorter time at higher latitudes) and \nwith high spatial resolution (10 m). Sentinel-2 has also proved it possible \nto map lake Chl-a and DOC (Toming et al., 2016 ). Thus, future research \nmay rely on the virtual constellation of high-resolution satellites (e.g., \nSentinel-2A and B, Landsat-8 and 9) to help overcome this problem (Cao \net al., 2022a ). \nDifferent satellite sensors have accumulated massive earth observa -\ntion data. However, applying this data for lake CO2 mapping is still \nchallenging. More research is needed to make the full use of this data. \nFurthermore, the high-frequency data of geostationary satellites (e.g., \nCMOS, Himawari-8) should be used to further develop a spatiotempo -\nrally coupled CO2 estimation model, which may help further eliminate \nthe effects of time-related differences coupled in the field data. These \nimprovements have the potential to significantly advance our under -\nstanding of the lake carbon cycle and correctly estimate lake carbon \nbudgets although it will not be possible to use geostationary satellites at \nhigher latitudes where most of the world lakes occur. \nAlthough the model proposed in this study cannot adequately cover \nall types of lakes due to insufficient field-satellite matched data in other \nregions, many lakes worldwide meet our model \u2019s theoretical assump -\ntions, indicating its huge application potential. About 80% of global \nlakes have an average water depth of <5 m (Messager et al., 2016 ), \nsimilar to the lakes in the ML_YHR basins. They are easily disturbed by \nwind and waves, which aligns with the use of ZSD as an indicator of cCO2. \nIn addition, >60% of global lakes are already eutrophic( Wang et al., \n2018 ), and the potential of Chl-a as an indicator of lake CO2 has also \nbeen confirmed in other eutrophic lakes with high productivity in \nAmerica (Balmer and Downing, 2011 ; Pacheco et al., 2014 ) and Africa \n(Borges et al., 2022 ). The many achievements in using different satellite \ndata to retrieve Chl-a and ZSD, or their related indicators in global lakes \n(He et al., 2022 ; Pahlevan et al., 2022 ) also provided good cause for \nfurther research. \nFurther promotion and validation of our model on a global scale can \nlead to great opportunities and challenges. The promotion and expan -\nsion of the authors \u2019 proposed model will open new doors to under -\nstanding carbon cycles of different types of lakes in climatic zones \naround the world; however, the model coefficients must be recalibrated \nto achieve this. The proposed model may even have to be re-retrained \nwith more indicators. For example, in cold and low-productivity \nboreal lakes, the role played by the photosynthesis of phytoplankton \nmay be replaced by the mineralization of organic matter (Sobek et al., \n2003 ). The dominant predictor of cCO2 would be DOC or in the case of \nremote sensing it\u2019s coloured component, CDOM. For saline lakes similar \nto oceans, the effect of the carbonate balance on cCO2 is enhanced (Li \net al., 2021 ), and salinity might be essential to the model to constrain the \nrelated process. \nWith the development of high-precision satellite products featuring \nlake CO2 key factors and the acquisition of more field data, sophisticated \nalgorithms developed with the help of machine learning (Chen et al., \n2019a ), and semi-analytical algorithms (Bai et al., 2015 ) have the great \npotential to develop cCO2 models with higher performance. It is even \npossible to establish a general cCO2 model for global lakes, leading to a \nmore accurate estimation of global lake CO2 emissions. T. Qi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remote Sensing of Environment 286 (2023) 113431\n175.Conclusions \nIn this study, a stepwise quadratic polynomial cCO 2 estimation \nmodel for lakes in the ML_YHR basins was constructed using the field- \nmeasured cCO 2 data and the Sentinel-3-derived Chl-a, ZSD, Tw, iPAR, \nAccuPAR, and Drs as input variables. Satellite-derived Chl-a, ZSD, Tw, \nand PAR products are good cCO 2 predictors for lakes in the ML_YHR \nbasins with conditions ranging from mesotrophic to highly eutrophic. \nBesides, adding time-related auxiliary variables to constrain the model \nalso helped improve model performance. Our model was the most sen-\nsitive to the uncertainty of ZSD products, indicating the dominant effect \nof ZSD on photosynthesis and mixing in regional meso-eutrophic shallow \nlakes. The reconstructed multi-year cCO 2 spatiotemporal dynamics of \nlakes in the ML_YHR basins showed dramatic seasonal variations, which \nwere low in the summer and autumn but high in the winter and spring. \nThe annual mean cCO 2 of ML_YHR lakes decreased with the increase in \nthe eutrophication degree and with the decrease in lake sizes. This study \nis the first estimate and the reconstruction of multi-year cCO 2 covering \nregional lakes using satellite data, which proves the application poten -\ntial of the remote sensing approach in large-scale lake CO2 emission \nestimations. In future research, field-satellite matched data from \ndifferent types of lakes and more high-precision satellite-derived CO2 \nindicators should be added to improve the model performance. We \nbelieve the remote sensing approach will contribute to further reducing \nuncertainty in global lake CO2 emission estimates. This contribution can \nalso better track CO2 emissions and thereby add to the knowledge base \nneeded to solve the eutrophication problem worldwide. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nTianci Qi: Methodology, Software, Writing \u2013 original draft.

An approach to the simulation of these \ufb02uxes at regional scale is proposed, based\non an array of unconnected one-dimensional (1D) physical\u2013biological\u2013chemical coupled models. The rationale isto massively assimilate satellite information, on one hand to derive accurate surface heat \ufb02uxes, and, on the other hand, to\nimplicitly account for the horizontal processes not explicitly represented in the 1D scheme. This method is applied here to\nsimulate the upper ocean physical and biogeochemical dynamics of the entire Mediterranean Sea over the years 1998\u20132004,and at a 0.5 1spatial resolution. The mixed-layer annual cycles are validated against the values determined from a database\nofin situ temperature pro\ufb01les, demonstrating the validity of the approach in various physical regimes. A validation of the\nsimulated annual cycles of the total inorganic carbon (TCO\n2) and of the carbon dioxide partial pressure ( pCO2)i s\npresented at a measurement site in the northwestern Mediterranean where both properties were determined in 1998\u20131999and in 2003\u20132004. An additional validation of the pCO\n2\ufb01elds is presented using along-track data collected during the\n\u2018\u2018Productivite \u00b4des Syste `mes Oce \u00b4aniques Pe \u00b4lagiques\u2019\u2019 (PROSOPE) cruise. The basin-scale air\u2013sea carbon budget derived\nfrom the model outputs shows that the Mediterranean Sea, over the study period, is close to equilibrium with theatmosphere, with a slight sink for the atmospheric CO\n2. This is in agreement with the results previously obtained via\nindirect methods and is supported here by a series of sensitivity studies. A detailed analysis of the pCO2and TCO 2seasonal\ndistributions in the Mediterranean Sea is provided for the \ufb01rst time. It shows that the biological processes play a major rolein shaping the pCO\n2seasonal evolution in the eastern and western basins.\nr2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\nThe Mediterranean Sea is subject to a growing\nanthropogenic pressure; in addition, the relativelysmall size of this sea may emphasize or accelerate\nthe effects of the atmospheric CO 2augmentation on\nits climate, as compared with the rest of the planet\n(Bethoux et al., 1999 ;IPCC, 2001 ). The evolution of\nthe atmospheric CO 2is regulated by the ocean,\nprimarily through the \u2018\u2018solubility pump\u2019\u2019 (physicalentrainment of CO\n2-rich waters to the deep ocean),\nand also through the \u2018\u2018biological pump\u2019\u2019 (sinking ofARTICLE IN PRESS\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/dsri\n0967-0637/$ - see front matter r2008 Elsevier Ltd.

D\u2019Ortenzio).particulate organic carbon or physical entrainment\nof dissolved organic carbon). Both these mechan-\nisms contribute to modi\ufb01cation of the carbon\ncontent within the water column and then the CO 2\nexchange at the air\u2013sea interface. In the Mediterra-nean Sea, the response of the ecosystems toalterations of the physical and biological environ-ments is expected to be important ( Duarte et al.,\n1999), although presently largely undetermined.\nIn this context, the Mediterranean Sea is a key\narea where our understanding of the mechanisms\nand feedbacks controlling the Earth\u2019s climate couldbe improved, and where our capability to predictthe responses to various scenarios of future envir-onment changes can be tested ( Turley, 1999 ). In this\nsea, the physical and biogeochemical processescover a wide range of temporal and spatial scales.Dynamics are controlled by two thermohaline cells\n(one for each sub-basin, the eastern and the\nwestern), both driven by the winter dense waterformation occurring in speci\ufb01c areas such as thenorthwestern basin and the northeastern Levantine,and by the spreading and modi\ufb01cation of theAtlantic water from its in\ufb02ow through the GibraltarStrait toward the eastern basin. The surfacecirculation and the mixed-layer evolution are\nextremely dynamic as a consequence of the varia-\nbility of the atmospheric forcing and of animportant mesoscale activity ( D\u2019Ortenzio et al.,\n2005). A wide range of biological regimes is present,\nwith phytoplankton blooms in the NW Mediterra-nean, the Alboran region and the South Adriatic,whereas the rest of the basin is prevalentlyoligotrophic ( Bosc et al., 2004 ). The limiting\nnutrients differ in the two sub-basins\u2014nitrate in\nthe west and phosphate in the east ( Allen et al.,\n2002).\nRecent measurements at Gibraltar indicate that\nthe Mediterranean Sea would be a sink of organiccarbon from, and a source of inorganic carbon to,the Atlantic Ocean ( Dafner et al., 2001 ). The\ninterannual and the sub-basin budgets are uncer-\ntain, however, except in a few, well-sampled, areas\n(Copin-Monte \u00b4gut et al., 2004 ). How the physical\nand biological processes modulate the exchange ofCO\n2at the air\u2013sea interface is presently unknown,\nas well as the role of the Mediterranean Sea as asource or a sink for atmospheric CO\n2. In summary,\ncarbon budgets are presently poorly constrained inthe Mediterranean. Basin-scales estimates of the\nCO\n2air\u2013sea \ufb02ux in the Mediterranean have been\nproduced only by indirect methods, as a residualafter all others terms of the carbon budget are\ndetermined. In particular, Copin-Monte \u00b4gut (1993)\ndetermined a weak sink for the atmospheric CO 2,\nwith a climatological integrated \ufb02ux of 0.35\u20131.85/C210\n12mole per year. A large uncertainty,\nhowever, is attached to the magnitude and directionof this \ufb02ux.\nThe dif\ufb01culty lies in the poor sampling of\nthe Mediterranean for the parameters of thecarbonate system. The few published measurements\nare essentially from the western Mediterranean, in\nparticular the Dynamique des Flux Atmosphe \u00b4riques\nen Me \u00b4diterrane \u00b4e(DYFAMED) site in the Ligurian\nsea ( Marty, 2002 ), and in the Gibraltar region\n(Santana-Casiano et al., 2002 ;Sempere et al., 2003 ).\nAs a consequence, the results of Copin-Monte \u00b4gut\n(1993) have never been re-visited, and, more\nimportantly, the temporal and spatial variability\nof the air\u2013sea CO\n2exchange at the scale of the entire\nMediterranean has never been estimated.\nLarge-scale observations provided by satellite\nocean remote sensing may help tackle the problem.For instance, the CO\n2air\u2013sea exchange can be\nestimated through empirical relationships linkingthe CO\n2partial pressure ( pCO2) or the CO 2fugacity\n(fCO2) to sea-surface temperature (SST) or chlor-\nophyll concentration (Chl). Such relationships are\nderived from regional in situ data sets and are\napplied at local or global scales using satellite SSTand Chl. This approach can retrieve the marinepCO\n2with an acceptable accuracy ( Cosca et al.,\n2003;Levefre et al., 2002 ;Metzl et al., 1999 ), but its\napplication outside of the time\u2013space domain inwhich it was developed is controversial, essentially\nbecause its empirical nature cannot, by de\ufb01nition,\nlead to any predictive skill. In the Mediterranean,Me\u00b4mery et al. (2002) found signi\ufb01cant correlations\nbetween CO\n2and SST or Chl in summertime only,\nwhich demonstrates de facto the inapplicability of\nthis simpli\ufb01ed empirical satellite approach in thisarea. They also concluded that, although SST andChl are two important proxies to estimate carbon\ndynamics, a realistic simulation of the CO\n2seasonal\ncycles requires that the \u2018\u2018history\u2019\u2019 of the watercolumn be known, which is not feasible throughempirical methods. Therefore, a modeling approachis needed to reproduce the physical state andevolution of the ocean and the biogeochemistry ofthe water column.\nSuch an approach has been used to characterize\nthe marine carbon cycle at global scale ( Sarmiento\nand Le Quere, 2003 ), but not for the Mediterranean.ARTICLE IN PRESS\nF. D\u2019Ortenzio et al. / Deep-Sea Research I 55 (2008) 405\u2013434 406Global circulation models, coupled with ecosystems\nmodels, were successfully used to describe the\nphysical and biological dynamics of the Mediterra-\nnean ( Crise et al., 1999 ;Crispi et al., 1999 ). To our\nknowledge, however, the speci\ufb01c issue of the air\u2013seaCO\n2exchange and carbon export has never been\naddressed except through one-dimensional (1D)modeling studies at speci\ufb01c sites, where data areavailable (i.e., at the DYFAMED site; Andersen\nand Prieur, 2000 ;Le\u00b4vy et al., 1998 ;Me\u00b4mery et al.,\n2002).\nIn summary, the insuf\ufb01cient number of measure-\nments and the inadequacy of the empirical remote-sensing algorithms precluded an experimentalcharacterization of the carbon dynamics in theMediterranean Sea, which in turn prevented the set-up of suitable and ef\ufb01cient CO\n2-dedicated basin-\nscale models.\nAnother approach is used here, which can be\nconsidered as an intermediate solution between thepurely empirical remote-sensing approach and themore complex simulations carried out throughcoupled general circulation models. A number ofunconnected 1D grid cells are put side by side inorder to cover the Mediterranean Sea. In each cell, a1D coupled physical\u2013biogeochemical model is run\n(Antoine and Morel, 1995a, b , AM95 hereafter),\nusing satellite-derived information for forcing asmuch as possible. When such data are unavailable,data from weather forecast models are used instead(see later for an outline of the AM95 model). TheAM95 model, precisely designed to use satellite dataas input, was validated at an open ocean station(Ocean Weather Station Papa in the NE Paci\ufb01c), yet\nit was not fully exploited because of the unavail-\nability of ocean color sensors at the time of the work(end of the Coastal Zone Color Scanner Mission in1986). The situation has evolved since the launch ofa new generation of ocean color sensors, includingin particular the NASA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS; McClain et al., 1998 ).\nThis new data set, combined with other satellite\nremote-sensing observations (see later), allows\nhere the AM95 approach to be fully developedand tested to estimate the CO\n2\ufb02uxes in the\nMediterranean Sea.\nSuch a \u2018\u2018satellite-driven\u2019\u2019 approach is a compro-\nmise relative to other approaches inasmuch as (1) anaccurate modeling of the mixed-layer dynamics ispreserved, (2) the water-column biomass is not\nexplicitly modeled through a multi-box food-web\nmodel (such as \u2018\u2018NPZD\u2019\u2019 models), but is ratherinferred from the satellite chlorophyll concentration\nused as a proxy, and (3) satellite data are either used\nas forcing or assimilated rather than being simply\nconsidered as validation tools.\nThe extensive use of satellite data allows mitiga-\ntion of possible adverse effects related to the purely1D approach. A minor impact of the 1D assump-tion is expected on the biological compartment ofthe model, which is a diagnostic model forcedentirely by the satellite surface observations (see\nlater the model description). The biomass laterally\nor vertically advected is, at least partially, implicitlyaccounted for in the local carbon budgets, thanks tothe assimilation of the satellite chlorophyll.\nLateral advection can signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uence the\nupper ocean density \ufb01eld in some regions, so thephysical simulation of the surface layers might bemore sensitive to the 1D assumption. The realism of\nthe simulation of the upper ocean physics is,\nhowever, crucial for the subsequent steps of themodeling (i.e., the biological and chemical compart-ments). Therefore, the \ufb01rst part of the paperessentially focuses on the physical segment of themodel, and the results are examined with somedetails at local and basin scale. Particular attentionwas devoted to the evaluation of the air\u2013sea heat\nand momentum \ufb02uxes, which drive the physical\ncompartment of the model. Once again, an exten-sive use of satellite data was preferred to calculatethe heat \ufb02uxes and the wind stress.\nIn the second part of the paper, the outputs of\nthe simulations are analyzed to (1) investigate thespatial and temporal variability of the pCO\n2in\nthe basin, (2) produce a \ufb01rst basin-scale carbon\nbudget that is not derived by indirect methods, and\n(3) evaluate the respective roles of several processesin controlling the total carbon content evolution.Sensitivity studies are also carried out to evaluatethe robustness of the basin-scale air\u2013sea CO\n2\ufb02ux\nand carbon export estimations to various para-meters or parameterizations.\n2. Outline of the AM95 1D model\nOnly the main features of the model are brie\ufb02y\ndescribed below, and the reader is referred to AM95for a detailed description, sensitivity analyses, and avalidation at the Ocean Weather Ship Station Papa(NE Paci\ufb01c). The selection of model parametersis described in Section 4.3. The four modules of\nthe AM95 model, which are successively run at\ndifferent temporal resolutions (see below, after theARTICLE IN PRESS\nF. D\u2019Ortenzio et al. / Deep-Sea Research I 55 (2008) 405\u2013434 407description of the modules themselves) are:\n(1) A turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) model\n(Gaspar et al., 1990 ), driven by surface heat\n\ufb02uxes (i.e., solar: Qs, long-wave: Qb, latent: Qe,\nand sensible: Qh) and wind stress, and using an\neddy diffusivity parameterization of the turbu-lent \ufb02uxes. The effect of the chlorophyll biomasson the heating rate of the water column isaccounted for following Morel and Antoine\n(1994) . The depth resolution is 5 m down to\nthe lower boundary of the model domain(nominally 300 m; see, however, the sensitivitystudies later on). The mixed-layer depth (MLD)is determined as the depth where the eddykinetic energy falls below a threshold of2/C210\n/C06m/C02s/C02.\n(2) A depth-, time-, wavelength-resolved phyto-\nplankton photosynthetic carbon \ufb01xation model\n(primary production model; Morel, 1991 ),\ndriven by the chlorophyll concentration andthe photosynthetically available radiation at thesea surface. Spectral resolution is 20 nm withinthe visible range, time resolution is one-tenth ofthe day length (so close to 1 h), and depthresolution is 5 m down to the bottom of the\nproductive layer, which is computed as 1.5 times\nthe euphotic depth (i.e., the depth where thedownward photosynthetically available radia-tion is reduced to 1% of its value just beneaththe surface). The model uses a vertical chlor-ophyll pro\ufb01le derived from the surface concen-tration ( Morel and Berthon, 1989 ). This method\nproduces a deep chlorophyll maximum, which\nis a recurrent feature in the Mediterranean\n(Crise et al., 1999 ). However, when the water\ncolumn is mixed (i.e., MLD larger than euphoticdepth), the chlorophyll concentration is con-sidered uniform throughout the mixed layer,with a constant value equal to the surface value.After integration over the three dimensions(depth, time, and wavelength), this model\nprovides the daily net carbon \ufb01xation rates by\nautotrophs ( P), for the mixed layer and the\nlayers below.\n(3) A carbon export model, which assesses the fate\nofP. This module combines Pwith the observed\ntime variations of the water-column carboncontent (itself derived from the observed changeof the chlorophyll content through a carbon-to-\nchlorophyll ratio), which allows a daily carbon\nloss ( L) to be estimated. All possible con\ufb01gura-tions as regards the relative values of Pand L\nare considered, and Lis then partitioned\nbetween local recycling of organic carbon and\nexport to deeper levels by means of the f-ratio\n(Eppley and Peterson, 1979 ). This method\nallows the new production to be decoupledfrom the export of carbon on short time scales(i.e., a few days), while they are reconciledover an annual cycle. It is worth noting that theexported carbon implicitly exits the model\ndomain, so that remineralization is supposed\nto take place only within the deep reservoir.\n(4) A chemical module, which assess the impact of\nthe processes described in (1\u20133) on the evolutionof the total carbon content (TCO\n2) and of the\npCO2in the water column. The possible change\nin total alkalinity (TA) due to nitrate uptake(Goldman and Brewer, 1980 ) as well as the\nchanges in TCO\n2and TA due to the formation\nof calcium carbonate are also considered. Totalalkalinity can also be modulated by salinityvariations, if any. The pCO\n2is \ufb01nally computed\nusing the relevant equations and constants ofthe carbonate chemistry ( Goyet and Poisson,\n1989;UNESCO, 1987 ). Along with the TCO\n2\nchanges, the oxygen evolution is stoichiometri-\ncally derived from the estimates of the new and\nrecycled production. Nitrate variations are alsoderived by using a C-to-N Red\ufb01eld ratio. Theseconcentrations, however, are never used toconstrain the modeling of the biological activity;they conversely are outputs of the simulation.Note that exchange of chemical species isallowed with an underlying deep reservoir where\nall chemical species are assumed to be constant\nover time. At the end, the carbon, oxygen, andnitrate \ufb02uxes resulting from eddy diffusivity,air\u2013sea exchange and export of organic carbonare computed.\nThe way these four modules are successively run\nis as follows:\n(1) The TKE model is run at a time resolution of\n15 min over the entire study period. Then itsoutputs are averaged in order to produce dailyquantities (MLD, temperature, salinity, andeddy diffusivity coef\ufb01cients). After this aver-aging, the mixed layer is assumed to berigorously homogeneous. As a consequence,\nthe quantities exchanged through its lower and\nupper boundaries are \u2018\u2018instantaneously\u2019\u2019 sharedARTICLE IN PRESS\nF. D\u2019Ortenzio et al. / Deep-Sea Research I 55 (2008) 405\u2013434 408by all parts of the mixed layer. Depth resolution\nis kept unchanged below the mixed layer.\n(2) The primary production model is run over the\nentire study period at its own resolution(see point 2 above), providing the time seriesof the daily Pvalues. An input from module (1)\nis the MLD, which is compared with the depthof the euphotic layer to determine the shape ofthe chlorophyll vertical pro\ufb01le.\n(3) The daily quantities produced in steps (1) and\n(2) are used as inputs of modules (3) and (4),\nwhich are also run at a 1-day time resolution.\nThe AM95 model is essentially controlled by\nsurface parameters, and is intended to evolvewithout any restoring processes, through assimila-tion of satellite-derived surface information. Verti-cal pro\ufb01les of physical and chemical parameters are\nneeded only for the initialization. This restriction\nconforms to the aim of developing a tool adapted tothe use of satellite data. Along the same line, thechlorophyll biomass is not a product of thesimulation, but is conversely an input to the primaryproduction model, and the corresponding datasource is expected to be an ocean color sensor.\n3. The surface physical forcing: a satellite approach\nThe rationale in this work is to compute surface\nheat \ufb02uxes using bulk formulas, which are fed asoften as possible by satellite data. The use of a bulkformula is abandoned to compute Q\ns, and satellite-\nderived \ufb02uxes are directly used. Details of theseselections are provided below. The upper-layer\nchlorophyll concentration must also be known,\nbecause the effect of the biomass on the heating rateof the water column is accounted for in the model.\n3.1. Short wave radiation, Q\ns\nIt has been often pointed out that the use of the bulk\nformulas in the Mediterranean leads to an over-\nestimation of Qs(Gilmann and Garrett, 1994 ;Tragou\nand Lascaratos, 2003 ), and various corrective factors\nwere proposed. A de\ufb01nitive bulk parameterization ofQ\nsi s ,h o w e v e r ,s t i l lm i s s i n g .I nt h i ss t u d y ,w eh a v eu s e d\nsatellite\u2014(METEOSAT)-derived Qs\ufb02uxes ( Brisson\net al., 1999, 1994 ), which have been shown to better\nreproduce the dynamics observed in the \ufb01eld data(Eymard et al., 2003 ) than bulk formulae.\nSeven years (1998\u20132004) of these data for the\nMediterranean area were obtained from the \u2018\u2018Centrede Me \u00b4te\u00b4reologie Spatiale de Meteo France\u2019\u2019. They\nare at a 3 km spatial resolution and with a temporal\nresolution of 2 h. They have been remapped on the\nEuropean Center for Medium Range Weather Fore-cast(ECMWF) grid (see later on), and interpolated\nto the ECMWF hours (0, 6, 12, 18 GMT), asdescribed in Eymard et al. (2003) .\n3.2. Selection of the bulk formula for Q\nb,Q e, and Q h\nThe Mediterranean is often used as a test basin\nfor the selection of the best-performing heat \ufb02uxparameterizations because, in a steady state, the netheat loss through the strait of Gibraltar should becompensated by the air\u2013sea surface gain. Thisbudget closure allows parameterizations of thedifferent heat \ufb02ux components to be tested ( Dietrich\net al., 2004 ;Gilmann and Garrett, 1994 ;Krahmann\net al., 2000 ;Tragou and Lascaratos, 2003 ).\nOn this basis, Castellari et al. (1998) proposed an\n\u2018\u2018optimal\u2019\u2019 scheme for the computation of surfaceheat \ufb02uxes for the Mediterranean Sea. This schemeincludes the parameterizations of Reed (1977) for\nQ\ns,May (1986) forQb, and Kondo (1975) forQh\nand Qe. The wind stress is calculated from surface\nwinds using the Hellerman and Rosenstein (1983)\nformula. This scheme was slightly modi\ufb01ed by\nPinardi et al. (2003) , by replacing May\u2019s formula\nby the Bignami et al. (1995) formula for Qb. This\nmodi\ufb01ed scheme was used here to compute the heatand momentum \ufb02uxes. The inputs to this set of bulkformulae are now presented.\n3.3. Selection of the relevant input parameters\n3.3.1. Air and dew point temperatures and SST\nThe air and dew point temperatures were taken\nfrom the 0.5 1resolution ECMWF analysis ( Jakob\net al., 2000 ), which are provided at 4 standard times,\ni.e., 0, 6, 12, and 18 GMT. An evaluation of thequality of these data is provided in the Appendix.\nIn the Castellari et al. (1998) scheme, SST was a\nblended product of satellite and in situ data\n(Reynolds and Smith, 1995 ). Various authors,\nhowever, have pointed out that satellite-derivedtemperatures could be more appropriate to derivesurface heat \ufb02uxes ( Caniaux et al., 2005 ;Clayson\nand Curry, 1996 ;Xue et al., 2000 ) because they are\ncloser to skin temperatures than any other source ofdata. Consequently, the Path\ufb01nder Sea Surface\nTemperature (PFSST) satellite data ( Kilpatrick\net al., 2001 ) have been used in the present work.ARTICLE IN PRESS\nF. D\u2019Ortenzio et al. / Deep-Sea Research I 55 (2008) 405\u2013434 409These data are available as global daily SST maps at\n4 km spatial resolution. Consequently, interpola-\ntions were needed to match the spatial (0, 6, 12, and\n18 GMT) and temporal (half a degree) resolution ofthe other forcing data sets. The diurnal cycle wasreconstructed as in Gentemann et al. (2003) , which\nallows the SST to be derived at any time of the dayfrom its value at 0 GMT, given the irradiance andthe wind intensity (taken from the other forcingdata sets). An optimal interpolation was applied to\nthe PFSST data to produce gap-free daily maps\nfrom the night passage, as described in Bretherthon\net al. (1976) andSantoleri et al. (1991) . Remaining\ndata gaps (clouds) were \ufb01lled with a simple boxaverage. An assessment of the accuracy of theseinterpolated PFSST data is provided in Appendix.\n3.3.2. Wind speed\nIn the Mediterranean, comparisons of the outputs\nof weather forecasting models with in situ data have\nshown that the wind direction is well simulated,whereas the intensity in near gale and gale condi-tions is less accurate (wind speeds greater than14/16 m s\n/C01)(Bozzano et al., 2002 ). Satellite-derived\nwinds (e.g., QuikSCAT) provide a suitable alter-native because of their accuracy in a wide range of\nwind conditions ( Draper and Long, 2002 ). Their use\nis, however, limited by their low temporal resolution(/C243 days) and by their restricted availability (only\nfrom July 1999 to 2002).\nIn order to produce realistic wind estimations\nwith a suitable temporal resolution, a speci\ufb01cmerging procedure between ECMWF and QuikSCATdata was developed ( Ruti et al., 2007 ), as adapted\nfrom Mertens and Schott (1998) . The rationale is to\nblend the ECMWF analysis data, which provide a6-h time resolution that is important for a correctsimulation of the mixed layer, and the QuikSCATdata, which provide a correction for high windspeeds whereas their temporal resolution is onlyabout 3 days. Details of the blending method can befound in Ruti et al. (2007) , and the QuikSCAT-to-\nECMWF conversion speci\ufb01cally used in this study\nis presented in the Appendix.\n3.4. Sea-surface chlorophyll concentration\nThe upper ocean chlorophyll concentrations\nderived from the ocean color observations of theSeaWiFS sensor by using the global OC4V4\nalgorithm ( O\u2019Reilly et al., 1998 ) have been shown\nto be overestimated in summer and fall ( Bosc et al.,2004;D\u2019Ortenzio et al., 2002 ). The cause for this\nbias is not de\ufb01nitely identi\ufb01ed (but see, e.g.,\nClaustre et al., 2002 ), and several regional algo-\nrithms have been proposed, as being supposedlymore adapted than the standard SeaWiFS proces-sing. The data set produced from the Bosc et al.\n(2004) regional algorithm has been used here, which\nhas in particular the capability of deriving realisticconcentrations in summer ( o0.1 mg(Chl) m\n/C03).\n4. Setup of the basin-scale AM95 simulation in the\nMediterranean Sea\n4.1. The spatial grid\nAn array of AM95 models encompassing the\nwhole Mediterranean basin has been set up, whichwill be referred to as the D\u2019Ortenzio\u2013Antoine\nMatrix (DOAM hereafter). This array has a\nresolution of 0.5 1in latitude and 0.5 1in longitude,\nwhich is imposed by the coarsest resolution of theforcing data set, i.e., that of the ECMWF data. Thedomain does not include shallow waters withbottom depths less than 300 m, where the perfor-mance of satellite observations is poor, and thedynamics of the water column are generally too\ncomplex to be simulated with a purely 1D approach.\nThe number of grid points is, therefore, 729 andrepresents 88% of the basin area.\n4.2. The initializing data\nThe MEDAR/MEDATLAS ( Medar Group,\n2002) winter climatological vertical pro\ufb01les of\nsalinity and temperature were used as initial\nconditions for each DOAM box. A linear inter-polation is performed to resample these data onthe model vertical grid (i.e., 5-m resolution).The initial vertical pro\ufb01les for oxygen and nitrateswere also derived from MEDAR/MEDATLASdatabase.\nInitial TCO\n2and TA vertical pro\ufb01les were\nderived from the MEDAR/MEDATLAS climato-\nlogical salinity pro\ufb01les using the relationshipsderived by Copin-Monte \u00b4gut and Be \u00b4govic (2002)\nusing data collected at the DYFAMED site. Wespeci\ufb01cally used their Eq. (4), which predicts TAwith a standard deviation of 1.8 mmol kg\n/C01, and\ntheir Eq. (6) for TCO 2, for which they did not report\nthe standard deviation. Other authors have pro-\nposed similar regressions, using data collected in\ndifferent regions of the basin ( Copin-Monte \u00b4gut,ARTICLE IN PRESS\nF. D\u2019Ortenzio et al. / Deep-Sea Research I 55 (2008) 405\u2013434 4101993;Santana-Casiano et al., 2002 ). The TA\u2013salinity\nrelationships derived from these studies all\nmatch, whereas the TCO 2\u2013salinity relationships\ndiffer notably, mainly because of the effect of thebiological processes, which modify the surfaceconcentrations in different ways according to theregions and seasons. These relationships agreebetter when only deep values (depths greater than300 m) are considered, i.e., where biological pro-cesses are negligible. Consequently, the DOAM\nsimulations were initialized with TCO\n2vertical\npro\ufb01les derived only from winter salinity data,assuming that the water column is well mixed in thatperiod and that the TCO\n2\u2013salinity relationship of\nCopin-Monte \u00b4gut and Be \u00b4govic (2002) for the deep\nlayers is representative of the average winterconditions in the Mediterranean. The resultinginitial \ufb01elds for the mixed layer and the deep\nreservoir are displayed in Fig. 1 , showing an\nimportant east\u2013west gradient in both the TA andTCO\n2\ufb01elds, with the highest values located in the\noriental basin. Finally, the atmospheric pCO2was\nderived from monthly measurements of CO 2con-\ncentration at the Lampedusa Island ( Chamard\net al., 2003 ) and from the corresponding sea level\npressure data from ECMWF. The resulting pCO2cycle was then uniformly applied throughout the\nMediterranean.\n4.3. Model parameters\nThe model parameters are as speci\ufb01ed in AM95,\nexcept for the light-photosynthesis model, whichincludes the photo-physiological parameters pro-posed in Morel et al. (1996) , and for the f-ratio. The\ndaily values of this ratio are here modulated as afunction of the surface chlorophyll concentration,\nwith the constraint that the average value over a\nyear in each grid cell is equal to the value predictedfrom the annual primary production in this cell,following Eppley and Peterson (1979) . The resulting\naverage is 0.27 for the western basin and 0.19 for theeastern basin.\nThe simulations are carried out over a period for\nwhich all the necessary forcing data were available,\ni.e., from 1998 to 2004, and include a spin-up period\nof 2 years (year 1998 being run twice before startingthe 1998 year).\nWhen surface heat \ufb02uxes are computed, satellite\nSST (PFSST) is used instead of the model SST eachtime the absolute difference between the twoexceeds 0.5 1C.

Results\n5.1. Basin-scale heat budgets\nThe annual averages of each of the four terms of\nthe air\u2013sea heat exchange, as computed over thewhole DOAM domain, are presented in Table 1 .\nThe interannual variability of the four heat \ufb02ux\nterms and of the resulting net heat \ufb02ux is weak,except for the year 2003, because of the strongmidsummer heat wave that occurred at that time.\nThe present heat \ufb02uxes are close to those of\nCastellari et al. (1998) . The average Q\ntot\n(/C01.98 W m/C02) is close to zero. This value differs\nslightly from the estimate of MacDonald et al.\n(1994) (/C05.271.3 W m/C02), which was used by\nCastellari et al. (1998) in their \u2018\u2018budget closure\u2019\u2019\ncomputations. The Qtotobtained here is closer to\nthe Gilmann and Garrett (1994) evaluation\n(/C00.371.1 W m/C02), which was calculated with a\nmodi\ufb01ed Reed\u2019s formula to assess the impact of theaerosols on Q\ns. The discrepancies with previous\nestimates of Qtotare essentially due to the signi\ufb01cant\ndifferences in the Qsand Qeterms.\nTragou and Lascaratos (2003) proposed an\naverage Qsof 185 W m/C02for the Mediterranean,\ncalculated using a 20-year time series of solarradiation measurements. This value is very closeto the Gilmann and Garrett (1994) estimation\n(183 W m\n/C02) and not far from the Meteosat\ncomputation adopted here (173.6 W m/C02).\nThe aim here was not to a priori improve the\nderivation of the heat \ufb02uxes by proposing newformulations, but to derive them using an existing,widely used scheme along with satellite data whenavailable. The individual terms and the budgets are\nslightly different from previous estimates, which\nwere, however, calculated from long-term averages\nof oceanographic data, whereas the values providedhere were estimated over only 7 years.\n5.2. Basin-scale SST\nThe time evolution of the SST averaged over the\nmodel domain is presented in Fig. 2 for the model\nrun and the PFSST, showing agreement between thedata and the simulated SST to within 0.3 1C. In\nwinter, the model SST shows a cooling trend, which\nis not observed in the corresponding satellite SST.The maximum difference is observed in the winterof 2002 (about 1 1C).\nWinter and summer averages were mapped\nfor both the model outputs and the observations(Fig. 3 ), showing an overall good agreement\n(o11C) as well as some local differences. In\nsummer, a 1 1C overestimation is observed in the\nAlboran Sea and south of Sicily. In winter,the simulated SST is generally consistent with theobservations, though colder ( E11C) in the South\nAdriatic and in the Aegean Basin, and warmer(E11C) in the Alboran Sea region.\nThe model is able to capture important features\nof the mean Mediterranean SST \ufb01eld. The coldest\nregion of the basin, the NW Mediterranean, is well\nreproduced both in summer and in winter, as well asthe SST \ufb01eld in the Levantine Basin, with thehighest temperatures of the area. The patchydistribution of the eastern basin in winter (e.g., thecold feature observed in the Rhodes region; Fig. 3 ,\nPFSST) is not fully captured, however.\n5.3.

Mean features of the MLD distribution\nThe time evolution of the monthly climatological\nbasin-average MLD is displayed in Fig. 4 , for\nboth the DOAM (average for 1998\u20132004; dashedline in Fig. 4 ) and the DOR05 climatology (solid\nline). The former is obtained from a TKE-basedcriterion, whereas the latter is obtained, as alreadymentioned, from a temperature-based criterion. Tobe consistent with the procedure used by DOR05,another DOAM MLD estimation was produced\nusing the same temperature-based criterion applied\nto the simulated temperature pro\ufb01les (dotted lineinFig. 4 ).\nThe mean MLD seasonal cycle is well captured by\nthe model. In winter, overturning produces a deepMLD, which becomes shallowest in April, when thewater column stabilizes. A strong strati\ufb01cation ofthe upper layer takes place in summer (MLD\naround 10 m or less), which ends in fall when the\nMLD increases again. Besides this general agree-ment in the timing, some differences appear in theabsolute values. The model MLD derived with theTKE criterion is shallower than the in situ data for\nmost of the year, whereas the bias is reduced duringwinter (i.e. December, January, and February).The situation is reversed for the MLD obtainedwith the temperature method, which agrees with the\nobservations for most of the year, although\nthe MLD is deeper in winter. Only the MLD from\nthe TKE method is discussed in the following,because it is the one used by the others modules ofthe model.\nThe MLD overestimation in winter is essentially\ndue to the MLD being too deep in the Ligurian Sea,the Gulf of Lion, the North Tyrrhenian, and Ionianand the South Aegean (see Fig. 5 ). In these regions,\nthe MLD sometimes reaches the lower boundary of\nthe model domain (300 m). This intense wintermixing is fully explained by a strongly negative,probably overestimated, heat budget over theseregions. For the three other seasons (see also Fig. 5 ),\nthe comparison is much better, with differences inabsolute values often o10 m and spatial patterns\ncorrectly reproduced (keeping in mind, however,\nthat the DOR05 climatology covers 30 years,\nwhereas the model runs are for 7 years only). Thesummer mixed layer is deeper in DOR05 (15\u201320 minstead of 5\u201310 m), which is, however, mostly dueto the method used to produce this climatology(see above).\n5.3.2. Local assessment of the annual cycle of the\nMLD\nAll individual temperature pro\ufb01les for the period\n1998\u20132004 were extracted from the DOR05 data-base and rearranged on the DOAM spatial grid.When the number of MLD estimations was 430 for\na given 0.5 1mesh box, the temporal evolution of the\nsimulated and in situ MLD were put together.\nWhen more than one in situ pro\ufb01le was available for\na given day, a mean value for the MLD andARTICLE IN PRESS\n-140-120-100-80-60-40-200Mixed-layer depth (m)\nJan Feb Mar A prM a yJun Jul Au gSep Oct Nov DecModel, Kz criterion\nModel, \u0394t criterion\nin situ  data (DOR05)\nFig. 4.

The stars in the bottom right panel show the location of the time series displayed in Fig. 6 , in particular the DYFAMED site\n(71520E, 43 1250N).F. D\u2019Ortenzio et al. / Deep-Sea Research I 55 (2008) 405\u2013434 415The best agreement in the western basin is\nobtained at the DYFAMED site ( Fig. 6a ; further\ndiscussed in Section 5.4), near the Algerian coasts\n(Fig. 6b ), south of Sardinia ( Fig. 6c ) and in the\nCentral Tyrrhenian ( Fig. 6d ). The main discrepan-\ncies are observed in the North Tyrrhenian ( Fig. 6e )\nand in the Western Ligurian Sea ( Fig. 6f ).\nIn the eastern basin, the cycle is perfectly\nreproduced close to Sicily ( Fig. 6g ), and the deep\nmixing observed in the Southern Adriatic Gyre is\nwell captured ( Fig. 6h ). The model MLD at the\nboundary between the Adriatic and the Ionian ischaracterized by unrealistically deep winter values(Fig. 6i ), reaching the lower boundary of the model\ndomain (300 m). This excessive winter mixing in themodel is due to a large heat loss ( /C08.8 W m\n/C02;\namong the highest of the model domain), which isnot compensated by advection related to the\nNorthern Ionian surface circulation ( Malanotte-\nRizzoli et al., 1997 ). Finally, in the Aegean and in\nthe Levantine basins ( Figs. 6j\u2013l ), the DOAM mixed\nlayers are consistent with the measured values,though slightly shallower.\nIn summary, an overall good agreement is\nobtained, in both the timing of the strati\ufb01cationand mixing events and in the absolute values. The\ndistribution of the errors (model MLD\u2014climato-\nlogy MLD) calculated for all the available MLDpairs ( Fig. 7 ) shows that the model MLD is on\naverage shallower than the climatology (the centralvalues of histograms are negative for all seasons).The distribution functions determined from theabsolute values of the differences show that thesedifferences are o20 m in 85% of the cases in spring\nand summer, o50 m in 60% of the cases in winter,\nand nearly always o50 m in fall.\n5.4. Validation of the TCO\n2and pCO 2seasonal\ncycles\nTo our knowledge, experimental data fully\ndescribing the carbonate system in the period\n1998\u20132004 are available only at the DYFAMED\nstation ( Marty, 2002 ) in the northwestern Mediter-\nranean. In addition, along-track measurements ofsurface pCO\n2were carried out during the Producti-\nvite\u00b4des Syste `mes Oce \u00b4aniques Pe \u00b4lagiques (PRO-\nSOPE) cruise (September\u2013October 1999), whichincluded also two 3-day stations ( Claustre et al.,\n2002). Validation of the DOAM model outputs\nusing these data sets is presented before the pCO\n2\ndistribution and the associated \ufb02uxes are discussed.5.4.1. The DYFAMED station\nThe SST ( Fig. 8a ) agrees well with the in situ data,\nalbeit slightly overestimated in summer and fall of\n1998 and underestimated during the winter 2003and 2004 (see the discussion about the mean SSTand MLD in the previous sections).\nThe TCO\n2, the pCO2, and the pCO2at 13 1C from\nthe model runs ( Figs. 8b\u2013d ) are coherent with\nthe timing and the absolute values recorded inthe observations (data from Be\u00b4govic and Copin-\nMonte \u00b4gut, 2002 ). Underestimation of the TCO\n2and\npCO2is essentially observed in summer of 1999 and\nin winter of 2000. The better agreement of the pCO2\nat 13 1C let us suppose that the disagreement could\nbe ascribed to some error in the simulated SST.\nThe seasonal cycle of nitrate is well captured\n(Fig. 8e ). The highest winter values are not\nreproduced, however. In winter of 1998, nitrate is\neven absent from the mixed layer. The 2-year spin-\nup using the conditions of 1998 is actuallyresponsible for this feature. Indeed, the repetitionof the lower-than-usual winter mixing of 1998prevents the refueling of the mixed layer after thebiologically induced summer depletion. This featureis therefore speci\ufb01c to the use of 1998 as the spin-upyear, and has no further impact on the simulation,\nbecause the stronger winter mixing in 1999 allows\nnitrates to be brought again into the mixed layer,better approaching the observed levels.\nConcerning the oxygen evolution, a good corre-\nspondence between the in situ data and the model is\nobtained, with a slight underestimation during thewinter periods ( Fig. 8f ).\nThe main carbon \ufb02uxes calculated by the model\nare provided in Table 2 . The annual total primary\nproduction is 20% lower than the estimates ofBosc et al. (2004) , using the same light-photosynth-\nesis model and the same input chlorophyll con-centration over the overlapping years (1998\u20132001)(127 versus 165 gC m\n/C02; their Table 2 ). Therefore,\nthe difference originates from the input temperatureand surface irradiance. The convolution of the\nannual cycles for total production and the f-ratio\nleads to an average ratio of the new-to-total annualproductions of about 35%, which is close to theestimates obtained from in situ measurements at\nthe DYFAMED station by Marty et al. (2002) . The\nannual new production is accordingly about43 gC m\n/C02, which is larger than the value computed\nbyMarty et al. (2002) . This difference is due to the\nvalue adopted for the annual average of the f-ratio\n(see sensitivity tests later on).ARTICLE IN PRESS\nF.

With an average atmospheric pCO2\nof 370 matm ( Chamard et al., 2003 ), the surface\nwaters are strongly oversaturated along the entireship track, except near the Gibraltar Strait.\nThe simulated SST agrees to within 0.5 1C with\nthe \ufb01eld data ( Fig. 9a ). An overestimation of about\n11C is found in the Alboran Sea and in the Algerian\nBasin (15 and 16 September). In these regions, theSST \ufb01eld is largely in\ufb02uenced by horizontalprocesses (the in\ufb02ow of Atlantic water and themesoscale activity, Font et al., 1998 ), which are not\naccounted for in the purely 1D approach used here.The underestimation (about 1 1C) observed at the\nvery end of the track (DYFAMED station) is due to\nan excessive cooling of the surface water, in\nparticular because the latent and sensible heat \ufb02uxesare overestimated.\nThe pCO\n2ship-track data show a signi\ufb01cant\nsmall-scale temporal and spatial variability(Fig. 9b ), determined by the local diurnal cycle of\nthe physical and biological effects on the pCO\n2\n(Bates et al., 1998 ). With a time step of 1 day, the\nbiological\u2013chemical compartment of the model\ncannot obviously resolve these scales, which, how-ever, does not prevent the simulation from provid-ing an average level comparable to the in situ\nmeasurements. The simulated pCO\n2is consistent\nwith the observations, except at the DYFAMEDstation, where an underestimation of about20\u201330matm is observed, and in the Alboran Sea\nregion where a strong underestimation is obtained.\n5.5. Basin scale pCO\n2\ufb01elds, air\u2013sea CO 2\ufb02uxes, and\ncarbon export to the deep layers\nA veri\ufb01cation was performed before the TCO 2\n\ufb01elds were analyzed, which consisted in computing\nthe total carbon stock in the basin, i.e., the\nintegration of the TCO 2\ufb01elds over depth\n(0\u2013300 m) and over the entire basin area andcomparison of the values on the \ufb01rst and last days\nof the simulation. The difference is about 0.05%,which shows conservation of TCO\n2over the\nsimulation period.\nFig. 10 shows the distribution of the 7-year\nseasonal averages of the simulated pCO2.A\nwest\u2013east gradient is permanently observed, though\nit is more pronounced in summer. The maximumpCO\n2values (close to 500 matm) are in the Ionian\nand the Levantine seas during summer, and theminima are in the Alboran region (about 250 matm\nin winter and 300 in summer), in particular becauseof the in\ufb02ow of cold Atlantic waters. These values inthe Alboran Sea are close to the observations by\nSantana-Casiano et al. (2002) in fall of 1998.\nThe extreme values and the amplitude of the\nseasonal cycles differ in the two sub-basins. ThepCO\n2varies between about 350 and 500 matm in\nthe eastern Mediterranean, which is, therefore,generally oversaturated with respect to the atmo-sphere (slight undersaturation occurs in winter inthe western Ionian). Much lower values are found in\nthe western Mediterranean (250 matm), in particular\nin winter. These lower values are explained by thein\ufb02ow of surface Atlantic waters, and also bystronger spring phytoplankton blooms ( Bosc et al.,\n2004) and a higher average f-ratio than in the\neastern Mediterranean.\nThe average annual air\u2013sea CO\n2\ufb02ux over the\n7 years of simulation is shown in Fig. 11 , and the\ncarbon budgets for the whole basin and for the two\nsub-basins are summarized in Table 3 . Over the\n7 years of the DOAM simulations, the westernMediterranean is a sink for the atmospheric CO\n2,\nwhereas the eastern Mediterranean is a permanentsource. The largest annual sink in the western sub-basin is found in the NW and Alboran regions(from 2 to 3 mol m\n/C02), whereas a moderate source is\nfound in the Tyrrhenian Sea (about 0.5 mol m/C02).

Over the 7 years of\nsimulation, the Mediterranean is nearly at equili-brium with respect to the atmosphere, with a verysmall CO\n2sink ( /C00.02/C21012mol).

Discussion\n6.1. Sensitivity studies\nA standard set of parameters, essentially identical\nto those proposed in AM95, was used in the\nsimulations discussed up to now (the \u2018\u2018standard\nrun\u2019\u2019; see Section 4.3). The comparison of themixed-layer temperatures and depths obtained withthis parameterization has shown a good agreementwith in situ data ( Figs. 2\u20137 ). The pCO\n2and TCO 2\nobtained with this parameterization were validated\nwith respect to data collected at the DYFAMEDstation and during the PROSOPE cruise ( Figs. 8\nand 9 ), i.e., essentially in the western basin. Several\nsensitivity studies are now discussed to furtherevaluate the impact of the choice of several\nparameters or parameterizations on the air\u2013seaCO\n2\ufb02uxes and on the carbon export to the deep\nlayers. In a given sensitivity study, only oneparameter or parameterization is modi\ufb01ed, every-thing else being kept unchanged (see Table 4 for the\nde\ufb01nition of these analyses and their results). In allsensitivity analyses but one (see later), the complete\nsimulation (spin-up plus the 7 years) was performed\nover the entire DOAM grid.\nThe parameterization of the physical segment of\nthe model was \ufb01rst considered. One modi\ufb01cationconsisted in extending the model domain down to600 m instead of 300 m (but still with a depthresolution of 5 m), in order to evaluate the impact ofignoring possible, albeit rare, deep ( 4300 m) mixed\nlayers on the \ufb01nal carbon budgets. In another\nanalysis, the assimilation of PFSST data wasswitched off, so the physical module runs freely,forced by surface heat \ufb02uxes and wind stress only.Heat \ufb02uxes at a time tare computed using the SST\nsimulated at time step t/C0Dt, ensuring internal\nconsistency. In order to evaluate the impact of theerror on the modeled SST on the computation of\nthe air\u2013sea CO\n2\ufb02ux, a third analysis consisted of a\nfull simulation where the surface heat \ufb02uxes wereARTICLE IN PRESS\n5\u00b0W0 \u00b0 5\u00b0E1 0 \u00b0E1 5 \u00b0E2 0 \u00b0E2 5 \u00b0E3 0 \u00b0E3 5 \u00b0E30\u00b0N35\u00b0N40\u00b0N45\u00b0N\n5\u00b0W0 \u00b0 5\u00b0E1 0 \u00b0E1 5 \u00b0E2 0 \u00b0E2 5 \u00b0E3 0 \u00b0E3 5 \u00b0E30\u00b0N35\u00b0N40\u00b0N45\u00b0N\n5\u00b0W0 \u00b0 5\u00b0E1 0 \u00b0E1 5 \u00b0E2 0 \u00b0E2 5 \u00b0E3 0 \u00b0E3 5 \u00b0E30\u00b0N35\u00b0N40\u00b0N45\u00b0N5\u00b0W0 \u00b0 5\u00b0E1 0 \u00b0E1 5 \u00b0E2 0 \u00b0E2 5 \u00b0E3 0 \u00b0E3 5 \u00b0E30\u00b0N35\u00b0N40\u00b0N45\u00b0N\nwinter spring\n200 250 300 350 400 450 500\npCO2 (\u03bcatm)fall summer\nFig. 10.

In that case, one\nexpects larger primary production in winter and\nlower values in summer.\nAnother set of analyses concerned the f-ratio,\nwhich is one of the most dif\ufb01cult parameters to set.The dif\ufb01culty is twofold, because the average leveland the seasonal evolution of this ratio can both beparameterized in several different ways, with noconsensus about the best way to proceed. Sensitivity\nanalyses were, therefore, performed following three\nalternative parameterizations, in which: (1) theannual average of the f-ratio is set to 0.3 everywhere\ninstead of being determined from the annualproduction as in Eppley and Peterson (1979) , and\nthe chlorophyll modulation is kept as in thestandard run, (2) the modulation of the f-ratio is\nremoved and the annual average determined from\nEppley and Peterson (1979) is used throughout the\nyear, and (3) the equivalence between the f-ratio and\ntheF\np-ratio ( Claustre, 1994 ) is assumed, and the\nf-ratio is, therefore, determined from the relative\nproportion of the micro-phytoplankton chlorophyllto the total-phytoplankton chlorophyll followingUitz et al. (2006) (through a \ufb01t to their categories\nS1\u2013S9; see their Table 6).\nThe results of these analyses are provided in\nTable 4 , as the annual 7-year averages of the air\u2013sea\nCO\n2\ufb02ux and carbon export to the deep layers. The\nmaximum annual CO 2source and sink obtained\nover the 7 years of simulation are also provided,with the corresponding year. Finally, the totalsource and sink terms integrated over the 7 yearsare also provided. The analysis of the values in\nTable 4 reveals that:\n(1) The standard run actually provides nearly equal\ntotal sources and sinks. The difference betweenboth (i.e., the net CO\n2\ufb02ux) is less than 1.5% of\neach term. Therefore, any change of either thetotal source or the total sink drastically modi\ufb01esthe net \ufb02ux.\n(2) In spite of what is said in (1), the sign of the\nannual average net air\u2013sea CO\n2\ufb02ux remains\nnegative in most cases, i.e., a CO 2sink to the\nocean, or, when positive, it is close to zero. Thisrobustness of the sign of the \ufb02ux tends tocon\ufb01rm that the Mediterranean is a slight CO\n2\nsink over the study period. One exception iswhen the f-ratio is parameterized following Uitz\net al. (2006) , which is further discussed below\n(point 8).(3) The total sink term is more variable among the\nsensitivity studies than the total source term.\nThis result indicates that the uncertainties in the\nparameterizations of both the physical andbiological segments of the model have a largerimpact in winter and spring, i.e., when theMediterranean is a CO\n2sink rather than a\nsource. A large part of the source term is locatedin the eastern Mediterranean in summer, whenthe effect of biology is low, so the uncertainties\nare essentially due to the modeling of the\nwestern basin.\n(4) The year 1998 is de\ufb01nitely different from the\naverage; it is always the maximum CO\n2source\nwhatever the parameterization of the model.The reason is a weaker mixing during winter of1998 compared with the winters of the otheryears (MLD is about 100 m instead of 300 m; see\nFig. 6a ).\n(5) Extending the model domain down to 600 m has\na negligible impact on the simulations (the totalsource and sink terms change by less than 2%).The same conclusion is reached when theassimilation of PFSST is switched off, whichmeans that the careful determination of thesurface heat \ufb02uxes and the internal consistency\nof the model allow 7-year runs to be performed\nwithout drift.\n(6) The three parameterizations of the air\u2013sea CO\n2\nexchange coef\ufb01cient tested here reinforce thetotal CO\n2source by about 6\u201326% and reinforce\nthe total CO 2sink by more than 40%. The net\neffect is a larger net CO 2sink. The Wanninkhof\n(1992) formulation gives the largest sink and the\nclosest value to the average estimate of Copin-\nMonte \u00b4gut (1993) (i.e., /C00.525 /C21012versus\n/C241/C21012mol C).\n(7) Using a constant PB\nmaxvalue increases the total\nCO2sink by about 22%, because export is\nincreased by about 20%, and slightly decreasesthe total CO\n2source by 7%. Using the\nBehrenfeld and Falkowski (1997) parameteriza-\ntion for the effect of temperature on PB\nmaxhas no\nimpact on the total CO 2source, and a very small\neffect on the total CO 2sink (+6%). This result\nindicates that the biological pump in theMediterranean Sea has little impact on theCO\n2\ufb02uxes in areas where the temperature\nexceeds about 20 1C, i.e., essentially during\nsummer in the eastern basin.\n(8) Removing the chlorophyll modulation of the\nf-ratio results in no change of the total CO 2ARTICLE IN PRESS\nF.

The seasonal cycles of the mixed-layer\nTCO 2and pCO2are not appreciably modi\ufb01ed\n(not shown). On the contrary, when the modula-tion of the f-ratio is kept unchanged and a\nrelatively high average value (0.3) is imposed, thetotal CO\n2source decreases by 20% and the total\nCO2sink increases by 17%. The combination of\nthese two effects leads to one of the largest CO 2\nsink among all sensitivity studies. The main effect\nof deriving the f-ratio from the parameterization\nofUitz et al. (2006) is to get a very low value for\nthis ratio, i.e., 0.16 on average, leading to astrong decrease of the total CO\n2sink, and then to\nthe largest net CO 2outgassing among all\nsensitivity studies. The carbon export to deeplayers decreases by 30% with respect to thestandard run, and a drift appears in the nitrate\nconcentration, with accumulation in surface\nlayers in summer (not shown). This indicatesthe unrealistic character of this peculiar studyusing the Uitz et al. (2006) f-ratio.6.2. Respective roles of mixing, biology, and air\u2013 sea\nexchange in the TCO\n2and pCO 2changes\nThe total alkalinity is essentially a conservative\nproperty in the Mediterranean Sea ( Be\u00b4govic and\nCopin-Monte \u00b4gut, 2002 ), so the pCO2evolution is\nprimarily driven by that of the TCO 2. In the model,\nthe daily values of the TCO 2change are calculated by\nsumming up the variations due to mixing (eddy\ndiffusivity plus entrainmen t), biological activity, and\nair\u2013sea exchange. The ave rage daily change of the\nmixed-layer TCO 2over the eastern and western basins\nis shown in Fig. 12a , and the relative importance of\nthe three processes in determining this change isshown in Figs. 12b and c . It is important to keep in\nmind that the TCO\n2change is for the mixed layer\nonly. Therefore, when a given process dominates in\nrelative terms, this may correspond to a small absolute\nchange, for instance when the mixed layer is shallowin summer. The same process may have the smallerrelative importance at another period of the year whenthe absolute change is, however, much larger.ARTICLE IN PRESS\n-1-0.75-0.5-0.2500.250.50.751\u03bcmol kg-1 d-1\nJan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct\n1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct\n020406080100%\n1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004Eastern Mediterranean\nJan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct\n1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct020406080100%Western Mediterranean\nFig. 12.

D\u2019Ortenzio et al. / Deep-Sea Research I 55 (2008) 405\u2013434 426The seasonal cycles of the daily change of the\nTCO 2are similar in the two basins ( Fig. 12a ). The\nmixed layer loses carbon in spring and summer and\ngains carbon in fall and winter. The amplitudes ofthe cycles are similar in the two basins, with,however, a stronger decrease in the eastern Medi-terranean in summer because of a strong outgassing.There is a remarkable stability, from year to year, ofthe time when the upper ocean switches fromgaining carbon to losing carbon (i.e., the time where\nthe daily change moves from positive to negative\nvalues; dotted vertical bars in Figs. 12b and c ). This\nregime change occurs repeatedly in March\u2013April inthe eastern basin, and 1 month earlier in the westernbasin, i.e., in February\u2013March. The conversechange occurs at the beginning of Septemberwhatever the year and the basin. This stability isobserved in spite of the interannual variability\nin the respective roles of biology, mixing and\nair\u2013sea exchange ( Figs. 12b and c ). Each year,\nthe time when the mixed layer starts to gaincarbon invariably corresponds to the time whenthe respective role of mixing starts to increase(September), whatever the basin and the relativeimportance of the two other terms.\nThe variability of the relative role of mixing\n(dotted\u2013dashed curves in Figs. 12b and c ) is similar\nin the two basins, with maxima of about 40% inwinter. The simulated MLD, which drives themixing term, does not show a strong east\u2013westgradient (see Fig. 5 ), and the consequence is a fairly\nuniform impact of the mixing on the TCO\n2changes\nover the whole Mediterranean Sea. Conversely,the relative importance of the two other terms\n(i.e. biology and air\u2013sea exchange) exhibits diverse\nbehaviors in the two basins.\nIn the eastern Mediterranean, the strong drop of\nTCO\n2in summer and spring ( Fig. 12a ) originates\nmainly from the outgassing toward the atmosphere,a consequence of the high SST\u2019s in the oriental basinat this season. The relative importance of biology ishigher in fall and winter, when the surface\nchlorophyll increases and the low SST induces a\ndecrease of the air\u2013sea exchange. In the easternMediterranean, the air\u2013sea exchange represents apermanent source of CO\n2to the atmosphere, so its\neffect on the TCO 2is permanently opposed to those\nof biology and mixing.\nIn the western Mediterranean, the relative im-\nportance of the air\u2013sea exchange is smaller than in\nthe eastern sub-basin, because positive air\u2013sea\nDpCO 2are smaller, and negative DpCO 2occur insome areas. In winter, the relative importance of\nair\u2013sea exchange and mixing are similar, while\nbiology dominates most of the year and in\nparticular during the spring phytoplankton blooms.\nIn summary, the TCO 2variations in the mixed\nlayer of the Mediterranean Sea are, on average,controlled mainly by air\u2013sea exchange and biology(both about 40%), whereas the mixing term has asmaller impact, because of the relatively shallowmaximum depths reached in winter in the Mediter-\nranean. The largest differences between the two sub-\nbasins are observed in summer, with the air\u2013seaexchange being the dominant process in the east,while biology still dominates in the west.\n7. Conclusion\nThe upper ocean carbon dynamics of the entire\nMediterranean Sea was simulated for the period\n1998\u20132004 with an array of 1D coupled physical\u2013biogeochemical models ( Gaspar et al., 1990 ;An-\ntoine and Morel, 1995a ). The surface heat \ufb02uxes\nand wind stress were derived mostly from satelliteobservations, including SST, shortwave irradiation,wind speed, and ocean color. Particular attentionwas devoted to the computation of these \ufb02uxes,\nwhich allowed 7-year simulations to be performed\nfreely without any restoring to observations.\nThe simulated SST and MLD \ufb01elds agree well\nwith observations ( Figs. 4\u20137 ). The main physical\nfeatures of the upper layers are reproduced, both interms of seasonal and interannual variability and interms of the extent of the strati\ufb01cation and mixingevents. The absence of important drifts in the model\noutputs indicates that the SST and MLD in the\nMediterranean Sea are weakly in\ufb02uenced by hor-izontal processes, at least when limited temporalperiods (7 years here) are considered. This resulta posteriori con\ufb01rms the usefulness and validity of\nthe 1D approach, which was a priori formulated\nbecause (1) strong horizontal velocities are rarelyobserved in the Mediterranean Sea ( Millot, 1999 ;\nRobinson and Golnaraghi, 1995 ), except in mesos-\ncale features, which are out of the scope of thisstudy, and (2) it can be realistic as far as surfaceprocesses are concerned and the horizontal resolu-tion is coarse enough, as already stated by severalauthors ( Dutkiewicz et al., 2001 ;Lascaratos et al.,\n1993;Vivier et al., 2002 ;Williams et al., 2000 ).\nA successful validation of the TCO\n2and pCO2\nvalues was performed at a \ufb01xed station (DYFA-\nMED) and along a transect (PROSOPE cruise).ARTICLE IN PRESS\nF. D\u2019Ortenzio et al. / Deep-Sea Research I 55 (2008) 405\u2013434 427Discrepancies occur locally, however (Alboran Sea\nfor instance), which might still be due to some\ninappropriateness of the 1D assumption, as well as\nto inappropriate parameterization of the biologicalsegment, in particular the f-ratio (as highlighted\nby the sensitivity analyses ). The biological compart-\nment of the model should be little affected by ignoringadvection, because the biomass evolution is directlytaken from satellite observations. Nevertheless,when the horizontal velocities are not negligible, the\nlateral transport of carbon can be important\nenough to substantially modify the TCO\n2and pCO2\n\ufb01elds. To our knowledge, however, the impact of\nthe lateral transport of heat and carbon on thesurface dynamic has never been examined in theMediterranean Sea.\nThe standard simulation indicates that the\nMediterranean is close to equilibrium with the\natmosphere, with, however, a small sink for\nthe atmospheric CO\n2. This result is coherent with\nprevious studies ( Copin-Monte \u00b4gut, 1993 ) based on\ncarbon budgets of the basin, and is supported by theresults of the sensitivity analyses carried out here.All but two sensitivity runs agree on the sign of theair\u2013sea \ufb02ux. Among the two exceptions, only oneresults in a signi\ufb01cant outgassing; it corresponds,\nhowever, to an unrealistically low average f-ratio\n(last line of Table 4 ).\nThe DOAM outputs allowed for the \ufb01rst\ntime a description of the spatial and seasonalvariability of the carbon cycle in the MediterraneanSea, and of the respective role of mixing, biologyand air\u2013sea exchange. This analysis reveals thedominant role of air\u2013sea CO\n2exchange and\nbiology, which both largely determine the impor-\ntant differences between the east and the westMediterranean basins. The ultra-oligotrophiceastern Mediterranean is oversaturated in CO\n2\nfor most of the year, while the spring phyto-plankton blooms signi\ufb01cantly contribute to theundersaturation of the western Mediterraneansurface layers.\nThe DOAM approach may still be improved, for\ninstance by introducing an advection scheme tobetter simulate the physical and biogeochemical\ufb01elds in dynamic areas, such as the Alboran Sea orthe southern Adriatic, or to extend its temporalrange of applicability. The approach using horizon-tal surface velocities as derived from satellite radaraltimeters ( Vivier et al., 2002 ) would probably be\nappropriate in the context of the present satellite-\nbased approach.In its present form, the \u2018\u2018array-of-1D-models\u2019\u2019\napproach can already be used as a tool to study\nthe changes in the CO\n2dynamics and carbon\n\ufb02uxes at the regional or global scales. In somesense, it can be seen as a sophisticated satellitealgorithm. The modi\ufb01cations suggested abovewould certainly improve the robustness of thesimulations, which could be checked throughcomparisons of their outputs with those of coupledgeneral circulation models in selected case studies.\nAs consistent long-term archives of both in situ data\n(e.g. Boyer et al., 2005 ;Kamykowski and Zentara,\n2005) and satellite data (e.g. Antoine et al., 2005 ;\nGregg et al., 2003 ) become available, the \u2018\u2018array of\nmodels\u2019\u2019 approach will also be adapted to assess thedecadal changes of the carbon cycle at the regionalor global scales.\nAcknowledgements\nFabrizio D\u2019Ortenzio was successively supported\nthrough the European Space Agency/ESTEC Con-tract no. 14393/00/NL/DC (CCN no. 3) and a post-Doctoral grant from the University Pierre et Marie\nCurie.

Air temperature\nA local evaluation of the ECMWF air tempera-\nture is provided in Fig. A1a and b , by comparison\nwith the air temperatures measured by the Azur\nmeteorological buoy deployed nearby theDYFAMED site. The buoy data are taken within\n1 h of the 4 ECMWF synoptic hours, then averaged\nand compared with the corresponding ECMWFvalues. The agreement over the whole range ofvalues is good ( Fig. A1a ), with an overall mean biasless than 0.7 1C, whereas a positive bias appears for\nthe air temperature predicted at 12 TU ( Fig. A1b ).\nThese results are in agreement with those obtained\nin the bay of Genova (northeast Ligurian sea) byBozzano et al.

When\nmonthly averages of the differences are examined(Fig. A1d ), the greatest errors are observed in May\nand September, with mean biases of about /C00.6 and\n+0.6 1C, respectively. For the rest of the year, the\nerror is less than 0.2 1C. Finally, when the same data\nare separately examined for each of the 4 synoptichours (dotted and dashed curves in Fig. A1d ), it is\nobserved that the error is not related to the\nmeasurement hour.\nA.3. Wind speed\nA correction is applied to the ECMWF winds\nused in this study. The correction factor is derivedfor each grid cell using QuikSCAT Level 3\nscatterometer surface winds ( Draper and Long,\n2002) as a reference. These data were obtained\nfrom the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Physical Ocea-\nnography Distributed Active Archive Center (JPL\nPO-DAAC) for the Mediterranean region and forthe period from July 1999 to 2002. They are griddedvalues of scalar wind speed, meridional and zonalcomponents, with a 0.25 1/C20.25 1resolution, and\ninclude rain \ufb02ags as an indicator of a possible\ndegradation of the accuracy of the wind value ( Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory, 2001 ). When QuikSCAT\nand ECMWF synoptic observations were availablein the period 2000\u20132003, the two measurementswere compared. For each ECMWF grid point, alinear regression between the two estimations wascomputed. To avoid the possibility of negative\nwinds, the \ufb01tting lines were forced to pass through\nzero (i.e., only slope values are retrieved). Acorrection factor was then calculated as the slopeof the QuikSCAT/ECMWF linear regression ineach 0.5 1box. These factors are subsequently used\nto re-adjust the ECMWF 6 h operational wind \ufb01eldsfor the period 1998\u20132000 (i.e., when QuikSCATdata are not available).\nThe correction factors speci\ufb01cally obtained in\nthe present study are displayed in Fig. A2a .ARTICLE IN PRESS\nSlope QUIKScat/ECMWFN=1060\n0100200300400Number of points\n0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0\nN=890\n0102030ECMWF Wind Speed (m s-1)\n0 1 02 03 0\nN=890\n0102030QUIKScat-Corrected ECMWF Wind Speed (m s-1)\n0 1 02 03 0\nBuoy Wind S peed (m s-1)Buoy Wind Speed (m s-1)\nFig. A2.

A2b and c ). The compar-\nison is restricted to 1999, i.e., a period notconsidered in the computation of the linear regres-sions. The underestimation of the wind intensity byECMWF observed here for the NW Mediterranean(Fig. A2b ; mean bias error is /C02.63 m s\n/C01)i s\nconsistent with the results of Bozzano et al. (2002) ,\nwho performed a similar analysis with a buoy\nlocated in the northwestern Mediterranean (Gulfof Genova). After the QuikSCAT-derived correctionis applied ( Fig. A2c ), the data are closer to the\nin situ observations (mean bias error \u00bc/C00.84 m s\n/C01).\nA single data set are then created and usedhere, merging QuikSCAT observations when avail-able and re-adjusted ECMWF data in the other\ncases.\nReferences\nAllen, J.I., Somer\ufb01eld, P.J., Siddorn, J., 2002.

A series of Cu 0.6Zn0.3Al0.1catalysts with various Al-containing precursors, including Cu-Zn-Al hydro-\ntalcite, aluminum hydroxide and Zn-Al hydrotalcite, were prepared by co-precipitation and fractional-pre-\ncipitation, respectively. The catalysts were characterized with XRD, TG, XRF, N 2physisorption, N 2O\nchemisorption, SEM, TEM/EDS and TPR. Results show that the Al-containing precursor has an important e\ufb00 ect\non the Cu substitution by Zn in malachite lattice, leading to various performances of the obtained catalysts. Thecatalyst with Al existing as aluminum hydroxide performed high Cu substitution in the co-precipitated zinc\nmalachite, and exhibits better catalyst performance compared to its counterparts. Aluminum hydroxide can be asuitable Al-containing precursor for preparing the Cu/Zn/Al methanol-synthesis catalyst.\n1. Introduction\nCoal gasi \ufb01cation and its downstream synthetic chemical industries\nhave attracted extensive attention from researchers worldwide because\nof the abundant coal reserves [ 1\u20133]. Methanol, a key chemical in C1\nchemistry, provides a pathway to transform synthesis gas from coalgasi\ufb01cation into a variety of important industrial products [ 4,5]. In\naddition to the enduring industrial relevance, methanol has great po-tential for chemical storage and distribution of hydrogen, and chemical\n\ufb01xation of CO\n2[6]. As such, methanol plays an increasingly important\nrole in the coal industry.\nIndustrial methanol is produced from synthesis gas mixtures (CO/\nCO2/H2) at typical reaction conditions of 230\u2013 280 \u00b0C and 5\u2013 10 MPa\nover Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3catalysts. The Cu-based catalyst was typically\ncomposed of Cu, Zn, and Al, with Cu/Zn used as active components,\nand Al was used as a structural promoter [ 7]. Any of the constituting\ncomponents was indispensable to the ternary Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3catalyst.\nAl addition has been reported to increase the BET surface area and\ncopper dispersion, leading to a remarkable increase in catalyst activity,\nand especially the stability [ 7,8]. The presence of Al 2O3was believed to\ninhibit the thermal sintering of Cu particles under on-stream conditions[9,10].\nTraditional co-precipitation is frequently employed to prepare the\nCu/ZnO/Al\n2O3catalyst, and it was widely studied by researchers [ 11].\nWith carbonates used as precipitants, the obtained catalyst precursorscomprised a phase mixture of di \ufb00erent hydroxyl carbonates, such as\nzinc malachite, aurichalcite, and hydrotalcite-like (HTl) compoundswith a general formula ((Cu,Zn)\n1-xAlx)(OH) 2(CO 3)x/2\u2219mH 2O[12,13].\nZinc malachite was regarded as the precursor of active components inthe catalyst [ 13,14], while the function of HTl compounds was con-\ntroversial in literatures. The Cu-based HTl compounds for methanolsynthesis from CO\n2have been investigated and the obtained catalysts\nexhibited good stability and catalytic activity [ 15\u201317]. On the contrary,\nBehrens et al. [ 14,18] suggested that large quantity of HTl precursor\nshould be avoided in the preparation of Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3methanol-\nsynthesis catalyst.\nIt was reported that the fractional precipitation was used to prepare\ne\ufb03cient methanol-synthesis catalysts [ 19,20], by which Al3+is pre-\ncipitated independently of Cu2+and Zn2+and existed mainly as alu-\nminum hydroxide. Chu et al. [ 19] synthesized the catalyst by mixing a\nbinary matrix containing Cu2+and Zn2+with Al 2O3support slurry,\nand the obtained catalyst also showed good performance. Bahmaniet al. [ 20] prepared the Cu/ZnO/Al\n2O3catalyst by co-precipitating\nCu2+and Zn2+in the presence of various aluminum hydroxide sols.\nThe obtained catalysts were shown stronger inter-dispersion between\nCu and ZnO, and the well-dispersed Cu nanoparticles showed improved\nactivity. ZnAl 2O4has been investigated as a support for Cu based cat-\nalysts for methanol synthesis [ 21\u201323]. The spinel-type oxide is an at-\ntractive oxide matrix due to its high thermal stability and mechanical\nresistance [ 22]. The potential ZnAl 2O4structure can be derived from\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2018.04.021\nReceived 12 January 2018; Received in revised form 13 April 2018; Accepted 17 April 2018\u204eCorresponding author.\nE-mail address: zhangyulong@nicenergy.com (Y.

In this work, catalysts containing Cu-\nZn-Al hydrotalcite, aluminum hydroxide or Zn-Al hydrotalcite were\nprepared and studied. The e \ufb00ect of Al combining modes with Cu/ZnO\nstructure on the Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3catalyst were studied according to the\ncharacterization and evaluation results.\n2. Experimental\n2.1. Catalyst preparation\nThe catalyst preparation methods were illustrated in Table 1. In co-\nprecipitation process, the solution of metal ions was prepared by dis-\nsolving the mixture of Cu(NO 3)2\u22193H2O, Zn(NO 3)2\u22196H2O, and Al\n(NO 3)3\u22199H2O in demineralized water. Then the solution was dripped\ninto a heated balloon \ufb02ask containing 100 ml of deionized water under\nvigorous stirring, with concurrent \ufb02ow of an aqueous solution of\nNa2CO3used as the precipitant. Na 2CO3solution was added with con-\ntrolled \ufb02ow rate to maintain pH of the suspension between 7.0 and 8.0.\nIn the fractional-precipitation process, Al3+with the designed content\nof Zn2+were added into the \ufb02ask in the initial step, and then the so-\nlution with Cu2+and Zn2+mixtures was added into the same \ufb02ask. pH\nwas, as described above, controlled by the \ufb02ow rate of Na 2CO3solution\nin both steps. All reagents used in this work were of analytical quality/\ngrade provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd.\nThe temperatures during precipitation and aging were kept at 80 \u00b0C\nby using a water bath. After aging for 2 h, the precipitate was \ufb01ltered\nand washed to remove Na+. Conductivity of the \ufb01ltering water was\nmonitored for the complete removal of Na+. Subsequently, the pre-\ncipitate was dried at 110 \u00b0C for 12 h and calcined at 350 \u00b0C under air\n\ufb02ow for 4 h (ramping at 2 \u00b0C/min). After tableting, crushing and\nscreening, the catalyst with sizes between 40 \u201360 mesh was obtained\nand ready for evaluation. The Cu 2(OH) 2CO3and CuO samples were also\nprepared by using the co-precipitation method at the same condition.\n2.2. Catalyst characterization\nX-ray di \ufb00raction (XRD) analysis was performed by a Bruker D8\nAdvance X-ray di \ufb00raction system using the Cu K line (1.5406 \u00c5) ob-\ntained at 40 kV/40 mA, with 2\u03b8 ranging from 10\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 [ 5]. Chemical\ncompositions of the catalysts were determined by a X-ray \ufb02uorescence\nspectroscopy (XRF), using a Rigaku ZSX Primus IIX-Ray spectrometer\nwhich is equipped with an Rh target X-ray tube at 3 kW. Thermo-\ngravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out using a Netzsch STA 449F3\nJupiter thermogravimetric di \ufb00erential thermal analyzer. The catalyst\nsamples were heated up to 750 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min in\nthe\ufb02ow of synthetic air (30 ml/min). Speci \ufb01c surface area of the\nsamples was measured using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 equipment.Before measurement, the sample was de-gassed in the Micromeritics\nsystem at 300 \u00b0C for 3 h prior to adsorption.\nScanning electron microscope (SEM) was carried out by a JSM-\n5900LV type (Japan) series instrument with a Schottky \ufb01eld emissiongun at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron micro-scopy (TEM) images were taken with a JEOL 2011 Electron Microscope\noperating at 200 kV. Simultaneous energy dispersive X-ray spectro-\nscopy (EDS) was used to analyze the element distributions in di \ufb00erent\npart of samples [ 5]. The catalyst reducibility was examined by a tem-\nperature-programmed reduction (TPR) using a Micromeritics Autochem\nII 2920 auto adsorption apparatus. The catalyst sample (100 mg) was\ndegassed at 300 \u00b0C under Ar for 1 h. After cooling to 50 \u00b0C, 10 vol% H\n2/\nAr with a \ufb02ow rate of 50 ml/min was introduced into the sample cell.\nThe temperature was ramped linearly to 300 \u00b0C with a heating rate of\n2 \u00b0C/min, and then ramped to 800 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C/min. H 2consumption was\ndetermined by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) in the test.\nThe dispersion of Cu ( DCu) and the exposed Cu surface area ( SCu)\nwere measured on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 auto adsorptionapparatus. The speci \ufb01c method was described elsewhere [ 5]. Generally,\nthe sample was \ufb01rstly reduced in a 10% H\n2/Ar mixture for 1 h at 300 \u00b0C.\nThe amount of H 2consumption was denoted as X. Then, the reduced\nsamples were cooled to 65 \u00b0C and exposed to a \ufb02ow of 10%N 2O/Ar\n(50 ml/min). Finally, the H 2/Ar mixture was used to reduce the sample\nat 300 \u00b0C again and the amount of H 2consumption was denoted as Y.\nDcuand SCuwere calculated based the following equations:\n=\u00d7DY\nX2100% Cu\n=\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\u2212Sn N W m g (2 )/(1.4 10 )( ) , Cu H19 2 1\n2\nhere nH2is the molar number of H 2consumed in second reduction; Nis\nAvogadro's constant (6.02 \u00d7 1023atoms mol\u22121); 1.4 \u00d7 1019is the\nnumber of copper atoms per square meter; and Wis the weight of re-\nduced catalyst [ 5].\n2.3. Catalyst evaluation\nThe catalyst evaluation was described in detail elsewhere [ 5].\nGenerally, the experiment was performed in a constant-pressure \ufb01xed-\nbed reactor, as shown in Fig. 1. A catalyst sample (100 mg, 40\u2013 60 mesh)\nwas diluted with 1 g quartz sand (40 \u201360 mesh) and the mixture was\nplaced in the \ufb02at-temperature zone of the reactor. The catalyst was\nreduced in a gas mixture (5%H 2, 95%N 2) at 230 \u00b0C under atmospheric\npressure before reaction. Then the test was carried out at the conditions\nof 230 \u00b0C, 5 MPa, and GHSV = 10,000 h\u22121with the feed gas composed\nof 80% H 2, 13% CO, 2% CO 2and 5% N 2(Air Liquide). Liquid products\nwere separated through a water-cooled condenser and collected into a\nvial. The remaining gas products were quantitatively analyzed with an\nonline gas chromatograph [ 5].\n3. Results and discussions\n3.1. Characterization of catalyst precursors\nDuring the catalyst preparation, a small fraction of precursor sam-\nples were collected and characterized by XRD and TG, as shown in\nFig. 2 andFig. 3. The results of Cu 2(OH) 2CO3were also presented for\nreference. According to the XRD results, both zinc malachite and Cu-Zn-Al hydrotalcite were found in sample HT. With Al\n3+precipitated in the\ninitial step, only hydroxy carbonates (zinc malachite and aurichalcite)were observed in the XRD pattern of sample AH, which is corre-\nsponding to other researchers' results [ 20]. Aluminum is supposed to\nexist as \ufb01nely dispersed Al\n2O3, and thus cannot be detected by XRD. In\nthe pattern of sample ZAH, peaks at 11.758\u00b0, 23.643\u00b0 and 34.728\u00b0 were\nattributed to Zn-Al hydrotalcite. Part of Zn2+was precipitated with\nAl3+in the initial step, and then zinc malachite was produced in the\nsecond step. Zinc malachite is derived from the malachite crystalstructure by substituting part of the Cu\n2+ions with Zn2+, which led to\na shift of the d (20 1) position [ 14,20], as shown in Fig. 2 b. The shift\nscales linearly with the amount of incorporated zinc into the malachiteTable 1\nThe atomic ratio and preparation methods of the catalyst samples.\nSample ID Al-containing\nprecursorAtomic ratio of Cu2+:\nZn2+:A l3+Method\nHT Hydrotalcite-like\ncompounds6: 3: 1 Co-precipitation\nAH Aluminum hydroxide Step I 0: 0: 1 Fractional\nprecipitation Step II 6: 3: 0\nZAH Zn-Al hydrotalcite Step I 0: 0.5: 1\nStep II 6: 2.5: 0F.

Compared with Cu 2(OH) 2CO3, d (20 1) position of the\ncatalyst samples shifted to high degree by di \ufb00erent levels. It can be\nspeculated that a substantial amount of Cu substitution by Zn was\nachieved in sample AH, while sample HT demonstrated a relatively\nweak substitution. The Cu substitution by Zn in malachite lattice is\nfavorable to the intimate contact of CuO and ZnO after calcination,\nwhich is supposed to be bene \ufb01cial to the catalyst activity for methanol\nsynthesis [ 25,26]. The XRD results showed that the composition of zinc\nmalachite was in \ufb02uenced by the Al-containing precursors, which led to\nvarious catalyst performances.\nCalcination of the precursor samples was simulated by TG mea-\nsurement in synthetic air, with the results shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen\nthat the decomposition of Cu 2(OH) 2CO3was completed by one step,\nwhile the composite catalyst precursors were decomposed graduallywith increasing temperature. In the DTG pro \ufb01le of sample HT, the peaks\nat ~125 \u00b0C and ~540 \u00b0C were ascribed to the dehydration of HTlcompounds, and the decomposition of high-temperature carbonate (HT-\nCO\n3) formed in the initial decomposition of HTl compounds,respectively [ 27]; the peaks at ~360 \u00b0C and ~448 \u00b0C were attributed to\nthe decomposition of zinc malachite [ 5,28]. In the pro \ufb01le of sample AH,\ntwo peaks at ~300 \u00b0C and ~490 \u00b0C should belong to the decompositionof zinc malachite. For sample ZAH, the peaks at ~345 \u00b0C and ~448 \u00b0C\nwere attributed to the decomposition of zinc malachite, and the peak at\n~125 \u00b0C belonged to the dehydration of Zn-Al hydrotalcite. Unlike Cu-\nZn-Al hydrotalcite, the DTG pro \ufb01le of Zn \u2013Al hydrotalcite did not show\nthe peak for HT-CO\n3decomposition, probably due to its low decom-\nposition temperature [ 29].\nCompared to samples HT and ZAH, zinc malachite in sample AH\nexhibited lower initial-decomposition temperature (~300 \u00b0C) and\nhigher \ufb01nal decomposition temperature (~490 \u00b0C) of HT-CO 3. Due to\nthe di \ufb00erent Al combining modes, the catalyst precursors presented\nvarious pyrolysis processes.\n3.2.

XRD patterns of the precursor samples.F. Zhang et al. Fuel Processing Technology 178 (2018) 148\u2013 155\n150350 \u00b0C for 4 h. For understanding their textural and structural proper-\nties, the samples were characterized by XRD, XRF, BET, TPR, SEM and\nTEM/EDS, with the results shown as follows.\nFig. 4 showed the XRD patterns of the calcined catalyst samples. The\nbroad di \ufb00raction peaks for CuO suggested that the structures of hy-\ndroxyl carbonates were destroyed at the calcination temperature andthe resulting CuO in the samples existed in a microcrystalline state. The\nsizes of CuO in catalyst samples were estimated from the width at half\nmaximum of the XRD peak through the Scherrer equation, as shown in\nTable 2. The result of CuO sample was added in Fig. 4 for reference. It\ncan be seen that sample AH demonstrated relatively small CuO crystalscompared with other samples. The possible reason is that the e \ufb03cient\nsubstitution of Cu by Zn in the malachite lattice of sample AH formedrelatively small CuO grains in the catalyst structure, in which ZnO could\nact as a physical spacer [ 30].The results of elemental analysis for the calcined samples were\nlisted in Table 2. The Cu\n2+:Zn2+:Al3+atomic ratios were roughly in\nagreement with the design compositions shown in Table 1. The speci \ufb01c\narea and pore volume of the calcined samples were also demonstratedinTable 2. The S\nBETfor sample AH was higher than those for samples\nHT and ZAH, which was in good agreement with the crystallite size ofCuO. Table 2 also presented the Cu dispersion results of catalyst sam-\nples obtained by the reactive N\n2O adsorption. The maximum copper\nsurface area was 34.36 m2g\u22121for sample AH. The samples with hy-\ndrotalcites as Al-containing precursors exhibited relatively low Cu(0)surface area. The results suggested that intimate contact of Cu and Zn\npromotes the exposed Cu(0) surface area, which showed a roughly\nlinear correlation with the catalyst productivity [ 13].\nThe calcined Cu/Zn/Al samples were also analyzed by XPS, with the\nresults presented in Table 3. The surface compositions of the catalysts\nroughly corresponded to the design composition listed in Table 1. The\nXPS peaks of Cu2p\n3/2around 933\u2013 934 eV indicated that Cu species\nexisted as Cu2+; the Zn2p 3/2peak at 1021 \u20131022 eV could be assigned\nto Zn2+. The depletion of the surface in copper was observed in sample\nHT and ZAH, which may be caused by the formation of hydrotalcitecompounds.\nMorphology of the calcined catalyst samples were examined by SEM\nand TEM/EDS. As shown in Fig. 5, the three catalyst samples mainly\nexhibited a \ufb01ber-like morphology in the SEM images. However, some\nplatelet-like phases were also observed in samples HT and ZAH. It couldbe supposed that the \ufb01ber-like phase was originated from zinc mala-\nchite, while the platelet-like phase was attributed to the formation ofhydrotalcite compounds [ 13,18]. Their morphologies were maintained\nafter calcination at 350 \u00b0C because of the so-called \u201cchemical memory \u201d\ne\ufb00ect [14]. Accordingly, the morphology results by SEM have a good\nagreement with the corresponding XRD results.\nTo further distinguish their di \ufb00erences, TEM/EDS was employed to\nexamine the element compositions of di \ufb00erent fragments in samples HT\nand AH, as shown in Fig. 6.

In sample AH, only the \ufb01ber-\nlike phase (E3) was detected. The composition results suggested that\nthe platelet-like phase (E1) was originated from the Cu-Zn-Al hydro-\ntalcite compounds, while the \ufb01ber-like phase (E2, E3) could be attrib-\nuted to zinc malachite. It can also be speculated that, compared tosample HT, zinc malachite in sample AH contained higher Zn content,\nwhich indicated a higher Cu substitution by Zn in the malachite lattice.\nThis result was in good accordance with the XRD analysis of the pre-\ncursor samples shown in Fig. 2b. Zinc malachite was responsible for the\nintimate interdispersion of CuO and ZnO in the calcined samples, whichcould facilitate the synergy between Cu and ZnO during reaction [ 7].\n3.3. The reducibility of Cu/Zn/Al catalysts\nThe calcined catalyst samples were also analyzed by H\n2-TPR mea-\nsurements from room temperature to 900 \u00b0C. The reduction pro \ufb01les of\nall samples exhibited a broad reduction peak accompanied by a small\nshoulder in the temperature range 100 \u2013200 \u00b0C, as shown in Fig. 7. Since\nZnO and Al 2O3could not be reduced before 200 \u00b0C, H 2consumption\nwas ascribed to CuO reduction. There are several discussions on the\nanalysis of CuO reduction pro \ufb01les. Gao et al. [ 27] suggested that the\npeaks in the pro \ufb01le could be ascribed to the reduction of di \ufb00erent CuO\nphases: the low-temperature peak was caused by the reduction of dis-\npersed CuO, whereas the peak appearing at high temperature was at-\ntributed to the reduction of bulk CuO. K\u00fchl et al. [ 31] considered that\nthe reduction of CuO might be accompanied by the formation of a quite\nstable intermediate (Cu 2O). Another explanation was that the TPR\npro\ufb01les might be divided into three peaks: the \ufb01rst reduction peak\nbelonged to copper oxide of the surface layer (surface CuO) which was\nin direct contact with ZnO species; the second reduction peak corre-\nsponded to an intermediate layer (bulk-intermediate CuO) being in-\ndirectly in \ufb02uenced by ZnO due to several atomic layer distance,\nwhereas the third peak \ufb01tted to reduction of core layer of copper oxide\n(bulk-core CuO) [ 20]. In sample HT, a part of CuO was derived from the\ndecomposition of HTl compounds, which was supposed to be embeddedin an amorphous Zn eAl oxide matrix, leading to relatively higher re-\nduction temperatures [ 18,31].\nIn this work, the TPR pro \ufb01les of samples AH and ZAH were de-\nconvoluted into two Gaussian-type peaks, and the pro \ufb01le of sample HTwas deconvoluted into three peaks. The peak positions and areas ob-tained by the deconvolution were presented in Table 5. As described\nabove, peak \u03b1was assigned to the reduction of highly dispersed CuO;\npeak \u03b2was related to the reduction of bulk CuO; and peak \u03b3in sample\nHT was ascribed to the HTl-derived CuO crystals. Accordingly, the ratioof dispersed CuO in the catalyst samples increased in the following\nsequence: HT < ZAH < AH. The result was in good accordance with\nthe XRD analysis. Large amount of Cu substituted by Zn may bene \ufb01t the\nformation of dispersed CuO. Zinc malachite as a catalyst precursorcould result in more active catalysts than those with malachite as a\nmain component [ 32].\n4. Catalytic performance and discussions\nMethanol synthesis from syngas includes CO hydrogenation and\nCO\n2hydrogenation, as shown below:\n+\u21cc \u25b3= \u2212CO 2H CH OH H 90.55 kJ/mol 2 3 298 (R1)\n+\u21cc + \u25b3= \u2212CO 3H CH OH H O H 49.43 kJ/mol2 2 3 2 298 (R2)\nIn catalyst evaluation, the reaction temperature initially remained\nat 230 \u00b0C for 24 h (stage I), and then it rose to 320 \u00b0C and was held for24 h again (stage II, heat treatment); after that, it dropped to 230 \u00b0C and\nmaintained as such for another 24 h (stage III). Since the high se-\nlectivity of methanol over Cu-based catalysts, CO conversion was con-\nsidered to be an important catalytic performance indicator for a Cu/\nZnO/Al\n2O3catalyst, as shown in Fig. 8.\nIn stage I, the CO conversion of catalyst samples changed in the\nsequences: AH > ZAH > HT. After heat treatment, the CO conversion\nof the samples decreased by di \ufb00erent extent because of the Cu sintering.\nAs shown in Fig. 8, the CO conversion of sample AH, ZAH and HT\ndropped by 16.41%, 18.26% and 24.28%, respectively. The results in-\ndicated that the thermostability of the samples varied as follows:\nAH\u2248ZAH > HT.\nThe catalyst sample with high Zn contents in the malachite lattice\ndemonstrated a high catalytic activity along with good thermostability.\nA possible explanation was that ZnO in the calcined zinc malachite\nstructure had two functions: 1) as nanoparticles which acted as a\nphysical spacer between Cu particles stabilizing the porous micro-structure; and 2) as a thin layer at the surface of Cu particles which\nacted as an essential ingredient for the active sites [ 33], as shown in\nFig. 9. This could also explain the reason that sample AH showed thesimilar thermostability with sample ZAH, while the similar thermo-\nstability improvement was not achieved by co-precipitating Zn\n2+with\nAl3+, as in sample HT.\nThe results suggested that aluminum hydroxide performed better as\nthe Al-containing precursor than Cu-Zn-Al/Zn-Al hydrotalcites didduring precipitation for catalyst preparation. High substitution of Cu\nwith Zn in zinc malachite precursors was crucial to the catalyst per-\nformance [ 11,20]. In the paper we have demonstrated that theTable 3\nXPS parameters of the Cu/Zn/Al catalyst samples.\nSample Binding energies (eV) Relative surface concentration (at.%)\nCu2p 3/2 Zn2p 3/2 Cu Zn Al\nHT 933.51 1021.42 54.46 37.01 8.53\nAH 933.38 1021.48 57.12 33.46 9.42ZAH 933.39 1021.53 54.13 36.48 9.39\nFig. 5.

With\nCu-Zn-Al/Zn-Al hydrotalcite compounds used as the Al-containing\nprecursor, the resulted catalysts demonstrated a poor catalytic perfor-\nmance. One possible explanation could be that part of Zn2+was con-\nsumed in hydrotalcite structure, leading to a low Cu substitution of theco-produced zinc malachite. Another possible reason was that alu-\nminum hydroxide was capable to release aluminum ions in an aqueous\nsolution by the follow reaction:\nFig. 6.

When hydrotalcite-like compounds were used as the\nprecursor, the aluminum ion was trapped in the brucitic (MII,MIII)(OH) 2\nlayers which were built from the edge-sharing octahedral, hence lost\nthe ability for serving as a promoter [ 18]. This could explain the reason\nthat sample ZAH had the similar Cu substitution degree, while its cat-alytic activity was much lower compared to sample AH. In brief, alu-\nminum hydroxide provided the disengaged Al\n3+used for modifying the\nco-produced zinc malachite, which demonstrated as an e \ufb00ective Al-\ncontaining precursor for preparing the Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3methanol\nsynthesis catalyst by precipitation methods.\n5. Conclusions\nA series of Cu 0.6Zn0.3Al0.1catalysts with various precursors were\nsynthesized by using di \ufb00erent Al addition methods. Cu substitution of\nzinc malachite was examined by XRD of catalyst precursors. Various\nphase compositions of the precursors caused by addition of Al-con-\ntaining precursors were veri \ufb01ed by the TG results. With aluminum\nhydroxide as the Al-containing precursor, the calcined sample demon-strated relatively small CuO crystals and high speci \ufb01c surface area. TPR\nresults revealed the variation of CuO particle sizes with various Al\n3+\naddition methods, which was in good agreement with the XRD results.\nCatalyst evaluation showed that the isomorphous substitution in zinc\nmalachite had a good correlation with the catalyst activity. The catalyst\nwith an aluminum hydroxide as Al containing precursor exhibited\nhigher substitution degree and better catalytic performance. Aluminumhydroxide also provided the disengaged Al\n3+for modifying the co-\nproduced zinc malachite. It was demonstrated in this research thataluminum hydroxide performed as an excellent Al-containing precursor\nfor combining Al with the active component of Cu/ZnO in the methanol\nsynthesis catalyst.\nAcknowledgement\nThis research belongs to the methanol synthesis catalyst research\nprogram (CF9300160021) supported by China's Shenhua Group Corp.\nLtd\u2026The authors thank Professor Haiquan Su and Jianli Li from Inner\nMongolia University for their kind assistance.\nReferences\n[1] R.

The  catalys t structure and  its performance  for methanol \nsynthesis were in vestigated. The results indicated that Al 2O3 as a structural promoter can inhibit C uO and ZnO crystallites fro m \nenlarging during calcination.  The catalyst with a Cu/Z n/Al ratio of 4/5/1 (molar ratio) exhibits the highest catalytic activity . With an \nincrease in Al co ntent, the amount  of (Cu 0.3Zn0.7)5(CO3)2(OH)6 phas e in the catalyst precursor be fore calcination decreases, whereas  \nthat of C u2CO 3(OH) 2 phase  incre ases; (Cu 0.3Zn0.7)5(CO 3)2(OH)6 in the precursor is beneficial to the catalytic activity  of the final \nCu/ZnO/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst. \nKey Words:   methanol synthesis; CuO/Zn O/\u03b3-Al2O3; parallel-slurry-mixing; catalyst precursors; role of Al2O3 \n \n \nMetha nol play s an i mportant role in che mical and energy  \nindustrie s; now aday s it is mainly synthesized  from syngas \nvia a het erogeneous proce ss using tern ary copper-ba sed \nCu/ZnO/Al 2O3 cataly st. Such a  process is usua lly operated at \nlow te mperatur e (200\u2212300 \u00b0C) and pressure (5 \u221210 MPa)[1]. \nThe copper-ba sed cat alysts are usually  prepared through  \nconventio nal coprecipitation m ethod; howe ver, recently, \nsome novel pre paration techni ques ha ve also been reported.  \nJensen et al .[2] develope d a flam e-combustion technique to  \nprepare the cop per-based c atalyst by  mixing a cetylacetonat e \nvapors of Cu, Zn, and Al with fuel and air, which may \nefficiently  control the uniform  disp ersion o f copper, zinc, \nand alu minum compone nts at  the m olecular  level, and  a \ncataly st with l arge surface a rea, high activity , and good  \nthermostability  is obtain ed. Shen et al .[3] prepared a  \nceria-supp orted  copper cataly st through coprecipitation; the  \ncataly st is a ctive for methanol sy nthesis even at a  \ntemperature below 200 \u00b0C. Usin g the chem ical \nreduction-depo sition m ethod, Shen et al .[4] obtained a class \nof nickel- modified multiwall ed carbon nanotube material \nNi/M WCNT, and Ni/M WCNT-prom oted Cu-ZnO-Al 2O3 \ncataly st prepared through coprecipitation method exhibite d \nhigh activity  for methanol sy nthesis. \nAlthough the  conventional  precipitation  is a mature \nmethod to prepare the co pper-base d cat alyst, various modific ations have been made, which has attracted much \nattention. These modificati ons may be su mmarized as two  \ncategorie s: (1) addition of different metal ele ments su ch as \nZr, V,  Ce, Ga, and M n[5\u22129]; (2) im provement of the \nprecipitation pr ocess. Be sides the ty pical precipitation modes \nsuch a s forwar d, reverse, and parallel-flow an d parallel-drip \ncoprecipitatio ns, so me novel precipitation te chnique s lik e \nhigh-speed  collision[10], gel-network[11], and \nurea-hy droly sis[12] coprecipita tions have been reported  \nrecently . Li et al .[13] found that the  insonation of the  \nsuspen sion du ring precipitati on and agin g step s could  \nenhanc e the activity of copper-based cataly sts appreciably . \nYu et al.[14] reported that the c opper-based cat alyst prepare d \nusing du al-frequency  ultraso nic method exhibits high er \nactivity than t hat obtained by s ingle-frequency ultras onic \nmethod. It should be point ed out that the particles o f \nAl-co mpone nt precipitate f ormed i n the  coprecipitatio n \nprocesse s are so fine that a n effective washing of the  \nprecipitate is ra ther difficult. Moreov er, many researche s on \nthe copper-base d cataly st conc erned only  the effects of Cu \nand Zn com ponents on its structure and property[15\u221222], \nwherea s the inv estigatio n on the effects of Al co mponent w as \nrarely  reported . The study  about the effect of Al 2O3 on \ncataly st struct ure and prope rty may offer so me useful \ninfor mation to improve the activity  and therm ostability  of GUO Xian-ji et al. / Journal of Fuel Ch emistry and Technology, 2007, 35(3): 329 \u2212333 \n \ncopper-based catalyst. It has been reported that optimum \nCu/Zn ratio is largely dependent on the method of preparation\n[23], but it is not clear whether the optimum Al \ncontent is also related to the method of preparation. \nIn this study, a series of Cu-based catalysts with various \nAl contents were prepared using a parallel-slurry-mixing \ntechnique. The relationships among the catalyst structure, \ncatalytic activity, and the Al content were investigated. \n \n1  Experimental \n \n1.1  Catalyst preparation \n \nA series of copper-based catalysts, CuO/ZnO/ \u03b3-Al 2O3, \nwith a fixed Cu/Zn ratio (Cu/Zn = 4/5) and different Al \ncontents were prepared using the parallel-slurry-mixing \ntechnique. \u03b3-Al 2O3\u2013water slurry was first obtained in a \nbeaker, with \u03b3-Al 2O3 ground and sieved to less than 300 \nmesh. An aqueous solution containing copper nitrate and \nzinc nitrate and an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate \nwere simultaneously added into the precipitating vessel \ncontaining the \u03b3-Al 2O3\u2013water slurry in parallel-flow manner \nwith vigorous stirring. The final suspension was aged at 70 \n\u00b0C for 2 h, then filtered and washed, and subsequently dried \nto give the catalyst precursors. After grinding, the precursors \nwere calcined in an oven to form the reference catalysts (unreduced). \n \n1.2  Catalytic test  \n \nCatalytic tests were carried out using a MR-GC 80 \nmicroreactor equipped with an on-line gas chromatograph. A total of 0.5 mL of catalyst sample diluted with quartz sand \n(both with a particle size of 0.45 \u22120.90 mm) at a volume ratio \nof 1:1 was placed in a stainless-steel tubular reactor, and then \nreduced in situ by passing the feed gas at a space velocity of \n8000 h\n\u22121. \nThe reaction of methanol synthesis was operated under \n483\u2212 553 K, 4 MPa, H 2/CO/CO 2 = (66\u221267)/(31\u221232)/(1\u22122), \nand an inlet space velocity of 10000 h\u22121. The product stream \nwas analyzed with an on-line 103-type gas chromatograph instrument equipped with a GDX-103 column and a TCD \ndetector. \n \n1.3  Thermal analysis of catalyst precursors  \n \nThermal analysis of the catalyst precursors (DTA) was \nperformed with a CDR-1 thermal analyzer by heating a sample (20 mg) at ramp of 20 K \u22c5min\n\u22121 from 298 to 773 K in \nnitrogen flow (25 mL \u22c5min\u22121). Before the DTA measurement \nwas made, all samples were thoroughly dried at 353 K. \n 1.4  XRD patterns  \n \nPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD ) patterns were recorded \non a Rigaku D/MAX-3B diffractometer with Ni-filtered \nCu-K\u03b1 radiation at a scanning rate of 5\u00ba/min. Before the \nmeasurement was made, the samples were ground and sieved \nto less than 300 meshes. \n \n1.5  IR spectra \n \nInfrared (IR) spectra were me asured in the range of \n400\u20131000 cm\u22121 with a Perkin-Elmer 1710 FT-IR \nspectrometer using a KBr pellet containing the corresponding \nsample. \n \n2  Results and discussion \n \n2.1  Catalytic activity and Al content \n \nFig. 1 shows the change in methanol yield and CO \nconversion over the copper-based catalyst prepared using the \nparallel-slurry-mixing technique with temperature. For \ncomparison, the one-step parallel flow coprecipitation method\n[24] was also employed to prepare a copper-based \ncatalyst with a Cu/Zn/Al ratio of 4/5/1. \nThese two catalysts with the same composition exhibit no \nobvious difference in the catalytic activity, although the \ncatalyst prepared using the parallel-slurry-mixing technique \nexhibits a relatively broad active-temperature range and gives a higher catalytic activity at high temperature (553 K). \nHowever, the parallel-slurry-mixing technique is more \nadvantageous, because washing of the precipitate in the parallel-slurry-mixing precipitation technique, where the Al \ncomponent is added in the form of \u03b3-Al\n2O3 slurry, is much \neasier than that in the one-step parallel flow coprecipitations \ntechnique, as mentioned previously. \nIt was pointed out that the promoting effect of Al 2O3 on \nthe catalytic activity is dependent on its improvement of  the \ncatalyst structure[18]. Catalytic activities of copper-based \ncatalyst with various Al contents are shown in Table 1. The \ncatalyst with a Cu/Zn/Al ratio of 4/5/1 exhibits the highest \nactivity, which is much higher than that of the binary \nCu/ZnO catalyst with the same Cu/Zn ratio. The BET surface \narea of the former is 45 m2/g and that of the latter is only 27 \nm2/g. This indicates that Al 2O3 is a typical structural \npromoter. The optimum Al content of the ternary copper-based catalyst is found to be approximately 10.0% \n(by mol), which is similar to the value of 9.5% obtained by \nZhao et al.\n[21] using a pH-following-the-track technique. \nVery high Al content leads to a decline in the catalytic \nactivity. This suggests that the optimum Al content is not \ndependent on the method of preparation.

Despite the  \ndiversified stan dpoints, it is irrefutable that both pure copper  \nand pure zinc  oxide are ina ctive for methanol sy nthesi s, \nwherea s the coexist ence of copper and  zinc oxid e \ncompone nts is the ba sis for c onferring catal ytic activity  for \nmethanol sy nthesis. Therefore , the sy nergic promotion of \ncopper and zinc oxide has received much attention. For \nexample, Ja nsen et al.[19] point ed out that the Cu(I)/ZnO with \noxygen vacanci es is the active phase for methanol sy nthesi s, \nand Zhao et al.[20] further expressed the opti mum active site \nunit in the form  of \nZn CuO\n. \nThe sy nergic p romotion between copper and zinc oxide  \nbrings about  the enhance d activity  of the reduced  \ncopper-ba sed catalysts (Cu/Zn O/Al 2O3 or Cu/ ZnO). With a  \nfixed Cu/Zn rat io, the  uniform  disper sion of Cu in ZnO leads \nto an inti mate contact betw een Cu and ZnO co mponents; \ntherefore, this ty pe of active sites are for med to the largest  \nextent to obt ain the be st sy nergy  and the highest c atalytic \nactivity  for m ethanol sy nthesi s. \nMoreov er, as shown by  XRD in Fig. 3 , it is reason able to  \nassume that the active sites are form ed from the \n(Cu 0.3Zn0.7)5(CO 3)2(OH) 6 phase in the precur sor during th e \nsubseque nt calc ination and reduction process. Fang et al.[25] \nalso pointe d out that (CuZn) 5(CO 3)2(OH) 6 is a main phase in \nthe cataly st pre cursor to obtain a highly active cataly st for \nmethanol sy nthesis. \n \n2.3  Unreduc ed catalyst \n \nThe unreduced cataly sts were obtained throug h calcinatio n \nof the precurso rs. As shown i n Fig. 4, XRD  peaks at 2 \u03b8 = \n35.6, 38.8, and  49.0\u00ba  are charact eristic of Cu O and those at  \n2\u03b8 = 36 .3, 31.8 , 34.5 , 56.5, 63.0, and 68.1 \u00ba are ascribed to \nZnO. The broa dening of XRD peaks of ternary  cataly sts \nsugge sts that t he cry stallinity  of CuO and ZnO in ternary \ncataly sts is lo wer than that in the binary  cataly st, owing to  \nthe fact that Al co mpon ent restrains c opper and zinc  \ncompone nt crystallite s fro m enlarging duri ng calcination.  \nAl2O3 acts as a structure pro moter; high Al c ontent favors a \nunifor m dispersion of different pha ses. Whereas, as  \nmentioned prev iously , an increase in Al co ntent results in a \ndecline in ( Cu0.3Zn0.7)5(CO 3)2(OH) 6 phase an d an increa se in \nCu2CO 3(OH) 2 phase; thi s is di sadvantag eous to the for mation \nof active sites. Thus, it could  be reasonably  conclude d that  \naddition of pro per amounts of Al2O3 in the bi nary Cu/ZnO is \nnecessary  to ob tain a ternary  catalyst with high activity for \nmethanol sy nthesis. 10 20 30 40 50 60 705\n4\n3\n2\n1\n2\u03b8/ \u00b0 \nFig. 4   XRD patt erns of unre duced  catalysts \n1: CuO/ZnO (Cu:Zn = 4:5); \n2: CuO/Zn O/\u03b3-Al 2O3 (Cu:Zn:Al = 4:5:0.6); \n3: CuO/Zn O/\u03b3-Al 2O3 (Cu:Zn:Al = 4:5:1); \n4: CuO/Zn O/\u03b3-Al 2O3 (Cu:Zn:Al = 4:5:1.6); \n5: CuO/Zn O/\u03b3-Al 2O3 (Cu:Zn:Al = 4:5:2.4) \n \nIR spectra of p ure CuO, pure ZnO, and binary CuO/Zn O \nsamples obtai ned by parallel flo w precipitation[24] proved that \npure CuO and  pure ZnO exhibit two shar per absorption  \npeaks at 583, 531 c m\u22121 and 515, 430 c m\u22121, respectiv ely, \nwherea s the bin ary CuO/ZnO shows only  a broad absorption  \nband around 482 c m\u22121 due to the interaction between CuO  \nand ZnO.

As mentioned previously; however, \nan increase in Al 2O3 content is unfavorable for the uniform \ndispersion of CuO and ZnO phase, which results in a \nweakened interaction between the two components. \n \n3  Conclusions \n \n(1) A series of CuO/ZnO/ \u03b3-Al 2O3 catalysts with high activity \nfor methanol synthesis were prepared using parallel-slurry-mixing method. Such a preparation process, \nespecially the step of precipitate washing, is much easer than the coprecipitation process. \n(2) The optimum Al content in the ternary copper-based catalyst is approximately 10.0% (by mol), and it is not dependent on the method of preparation. \n(3) Al component acts as a structural promoter and restrains the active component grains from enlarging during the calcination of catalyst precursors. \n(4) The formation of catalyst precursor phase depends on Al content. With a low Al content, (Cu\n0.3Zn0.7)5(CO 3)2(OH) 6 is \nthe main phase in the precursors; with an increase in Al \ncontent, (Cu 0.3Zn0.7)5(CO 3)2(OH) 6 phase decreases and \nCu2CO 3(OH) 2 phase increases. The phase \n(Cu 0.3Zn0.7)5(CO 3)2(OH) 6 is beneficial to the catalytic activity \nof the final Cu/ZnO/ \u03b3-Al 2O3 catalyst. \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Wang G L, Li C Y.

To make methanol produ ction via CO 2hydrogenation\na competitive process, the optimal operating conditions wi th minimum production\ncost need to be considered. This paper studied an applicatio n of response surface\nmethodology (RSM) in optimization of methanol production v ia CO2hydrogenation.\nThe objective of this optimization was to minimize the metha nol production cost per\ntons produced methanol. The sensitivity analysis was perfo rmed to determine the\nparameters that show signi\ufb01cant impacts on the methanol pro duction cost. Response\nsurface methodology coupled with non-linear programming s olver were used as the\noptimization tool. The results showed RSM was successfully applied to the methanol\nproductionviaCO 2hydrogenationprocess.Theobtainedminimummethanolprod uction\ncost was $565.54 per ton produced methanol with the optimal o perating conditions as\nfollows.

CO 2emission from this combustion is considered as the second con tribution\ntothegreenhousee\ufb00ect(9\u201326%),afterthewatervaporandclouds (36\u201372%).Therecentattempts\npredictthatCO 2willshowstrongergreenhousee\ufb00ectwhenitsamountintheatmo sphereisdouble\n(Jaworowski et al., 1992 ).

Uses of methanol is found in many\nhousehold products, including paints, varnishes, cleaning\nproducts ( Dasgupta and Klein, 2014 ). Moreover, methanol can\nuse as a motor fuel or gasoline blending component ( Ingamells\nandLindquist,1975 ).Themethanol\u2014fueledvehiclesuseablend\nof85percentmethanolwith15percentunleadedgasoline(M85)\n(Ingamells and Lindquist, 1975; EPA, 2002; Bukhtiyarova et a l.,\n2017).Fromlaboratoryandroadtestsindicatethataddingof10%\nmethanolcanraiseoctane2\u20133numbers.Intheresearchof Gabele\n(1990),theresultsshowedthatincreaseofmethanolcontentdoes\nnota\ufb00ecttheemissionrateofexhaustgas.\nIn the conventional methanol production, methanol\nis produced from petroleum product (synthesis gas) via\nhydrogenation of CO and CO 2, and reversed water\u2014gas\nshift reaction ( Mar\u00eda et al., 2013 ). The commercial methanol\nproductions from synthesis gas use CuO/ZnO/Al 2O3as catalyst\n(Sayah et al., 2010; Jadhav et al., 2014 ). The commercial\nCuO/ZnO/Al 2O3coupled with a zeolite membrane reactor can\nprovide higher CO 2conversion, methanol yield, and selectivity\ncompared with a traditional reactor ( Gallucci et al., 2004 ).\nCopper based catalyst is mostly used for CO 2hydrogenation to\nmethanol due to its cheap and higher catalyst activity ( Ali et al.,\n2015). Saito and Murata studied of Al 2O3supported Cu-based\ncatalyst with Co-precipitation technique. The catalyst show s\nhigh activity and the stability was improved by adding colloi dal\nsilica(SaitoandMurata,2004 ).\nSeveraldevelopmentsofcatalystsusedincatalyticconvers ion\ntoimprovetheperformanceofcatalystwerestudied.MgandMn\nwas promoted on CuZnZr catalyst. Adding of MgO and MnO\nlead to increase in catalytic activity of the catalyst ( Sloczy\u00b4nski\net al., 2003 ). Doping of Mn to Cu/Zn/Zr catalyst can increase\nthe methanol production rate. The zirconium indicates the\nadvantageous in\ufb02uence on the catalyst activity ( Lachowska and\nSkrzypek,2004 ).ThePd/ZnOcatalystsovermulti-walledcarbon\nnanotubes was found to have the turnover frequency reached\n0.015persecond( Liangetal.,2009 ).\nRecently, the production of methanol from direct CO 2\nhydrogenation is of interest ( Samimi et al., 2017; Marlin et al.,\n2018). The process has potential to mitigate the CO 2emission\nto the atmosphere. The methanol production from direct CO 2\n(using pure sources of CO 2and H2) has several advantages\nover the conventional process\u2014it results in signi\ufb01cantly le ss\nbyproducts, and requires less energy in product puri\ufb01cation\n(Marlinetal.,2018 ).However,themethanolproductioncostvia\ndirect CO 2hydrogenation is 2\u20132.5 times higher than the cost\nof conventional process ( Atsonics et al., 2015 ). The process of\nmethanol production via CO 2hydrogenation consumes more\nutilities than the conventional methanol production ( Machado\netal.,2014 ).\nThere are some studies on simulation\u2014based optimization\nof methanol synthesis to increase the methanol production\nrate (Hoseiny et al., 2016; Leonzio, 2017 ). For methanol\nproductionfromsynthesisgas,thee\ufb00ectsofchangesinoperati ng\nconditions on the production rate were studied to maximize\nthe production rate. The studied operating parameters were\nfeed \ufb02ow rate, pressure and temperature of feed, and thecoolingwatertemperature.Theresultsshowedthatthemetha nol\nproduction rate can be increased by 7% with higher feed\npressure and lower feed temperature ( Hoseiny et al., 2016 ).\nFor methanol synthesis via direct CO 2hydrogenation, Grazia\nLeonzio developed mathematical model of the reactor used\nin methanol production. The impacts of reaction temperature,\nreaction pressure, H 2/CO2ratio, and the recycle factor on\nmethanol production rate and reactor volume were studied\n(Leonzio,2017 ).\nHowever, optimization of methanol production via CO 2\nhydrogenation, which considers all possible operating\nparameters, for the minimum production cost has not been\nstudied. This paper studied an application of response surface\nmethodology (RSM) in optimization of methanol production\nvia CO 2hydrogenation process. To be able to apply the RSM\nin optimization, the response surface has to be in the form\nof the second order model. The sensitivity analysis was used\nto determine the signi\ufb01cant operating parameters. The RSM\ncoupled with non-linear solver was employed to obtain the\nlocal optimal operating conditions and the minimum methanol\nproductioncost.\nThispaperisorganizedasfollows:sectionProcesssimulatio n\nand economic evaluation gives details of process simulation\nand economic evaluation.

An increase in press ure\nand decrease in temperature leads to increase of the equilibr ium\nconversion of CO 2to methanol ( Witoon et al., 2015 ). The eight\nstudied parameters are (1 and 2) inlet pressure and temperature\nto the \ufb01rst reactor, ERV-100, for CO 2and H 2conversion\nconditions, (3) inlet temperature to the \ufb01rst separator for\nmethanol product separation condition, (4) inlet pressure to t he\nsecondreactor,ERV-101,forCO 2andH2conversionconditions,\n(5 and 6) outlet temperature of both coolers, located after\nthe second reactor, for methanol product separation conditio n\nfrom gas and liquid mixture, (7) outlet pressure at the valve\nVLV-102 for recovering methanol from gas phase mixture, (8)\nInlet temperature to the \ufb01rst distillation column for separatio n\nbetween liquid methanol and water products, and gaseous\nunreactedreactantseparation.\nFor all parameters, except inlet temperature to the \ufb01rst\nreactor, we performed the sensitivity analysis by varying val ue\nof interested parameter within the range \u00b125% of its base\nvalue, and \ufb01xing other parameters at their base values. For\ninlet temperature to the \ufb01rst reactor parameter, we varied the\nvalue of temperature within the range \u00b110% of its base value.\nTable2shows the base value used in sensitivity analysis of\neachparameter.\nSensitivity Analysis: Results\nThe results from sensitivity analysis show that there are\n\ufb01ve parameters that show signi\ufb01cant impacts on methanol\nproduction cost. Figure2 shows inversely proportional\nrelationship between operating parameters and methanol\nproduction cost (the methanol production cost decreases with\nan increase in the value of parameter).

The\nobjective is to minimize the methanol production cost per\ntons produced methanol ($/tons produced methanol). Response\nsurface methodology is a statistical tool used to represent\nthe relationship between independent variables and dependen t\nvariable(s). In this work, RSM was employed to represent the\nrelationship between signi\ufb01cant operating parameters and th e\nmethanol production cost per tons produced methanol. The\nsigni\ufb01cant operating parameters (decision variables) are th e\nsigni\ufb01cant parameters obtained from sensitivity analysis (i n\nsectionSensitivityanalysis)whicharex 1:inletpressuretothe1st\nreactor, x 2: inlet temperature to the 1st reactor, x 3: inlet pressure\nto the 2nd reactor, x 4: outlet temperature of the liquid stream\ncooler after the 2nd reactor, x 5: inlet temperature to the 1st\ndistillationcolumn.\nFigure4 represents simulation\u2014optimization algorithm. In\nthe algorithm, the range of each decision variables was \ufb01rstdetermined. In this work, the ranges of decision variables\nwere obtained from literature ( Shen et al., 2000; Witoon\net al., 2015 ). Factorial design with two levels (2kFactorial\ndesign, section 2kFactorial design) and a center point were\nused as a data set of the decision variables. Then, process\nsimulation, coupled with cost analysis, was run corresponding\nto operating conditions in the data set to obtained methanol\nproduction costs. The data of operating conditions and the\ncorresponding methanol production costs were combined and\n\ufb01t the \ufb01rst order model by regression analysis (using Design\nExpert 11 software). If the data \ufb01t the \ufb01rst order model\n(R\u2014squared >0.7), it means that the region of operating\nconditions and methanol production costs is in linear region.\nThe steepest descent (section Steepest descent) was performed\nto move operating conditions to the region of lower methanol\nproduction cost. On the other hand, if the data do not \ufb01t\nthe \ufb01rst order model, it means that the data are in non-\nlinear region. The Box\u2014Behnken Design [BBD, section Box\u2014\nBehnken design (BBD)] was performed to collect more data\nin non-linear region. All data were then combined to \ufb01t the\nsecond order (non-linear) model.

Figure6 shows steepest\ndescent in moving the operating conditions to lower methanol\nproductioncostregion.\nFrom the steepest descent results, for the \ufb01rst reactor,\nan increase in inlet pressure from 56.0 to 58.0 bar, and a\ndecrease in inlet temperature from 192.0 to 183.0\u25e6C yielded\nan increase in methanol product at equilibrium condition\n(%conversion increased from 40 to 45%). For the second\nreactor, a decrease in inlet pressure from 118.0 to 102.0\nbar yielded an increase in methanol product in the reactor.\nThe outlet temperature of the liquid stream cooler after the2nd reactor decreased from 74\u25e6C to around 65\u25e6C yielded\nan increase in liquid methanol separated from the separator.\nThe inlet temperature to the \ufb01rst distillation column increased\nfrom 48.0 to 52.0\u25e6C yielded higher e\ufb03ciency to separate most\nof remaining CO 2and lighter components from methanol\nandwater.\nThe steepest descent moves the operating conditions to the\nnew conditions as follows: inlet pressure to the \ufb01rst reactor:\n58.84 bar, inlet temperature to the \ufb01rst reactor: 184.0\u25e6C, inlet\npressure to the second reactor: 106.64 bar, outlet temperatur e\nof the liquid stream cooler after the second reactor: 65.54\u25e6C,\nand inlet temperature to the \ufb01rst distillation column 52.75\u25e6C.\nWe then used these new operating conditions as the middle\nvalue of the range of decision variables. The ranges of the\nnew operating conditions are shown in Table3, Data set\n2column.\nThe new data set (Data set 2) was then constructed with\n2kfactorial design. The corresponding methanol production\ncosts were collected, as shown in Figure6. Most of the\ndata in data set 2 shows lower methanol production cost\nthan data set 1, except the data at low inlet pressure to\nthe \ufb01rst reactor. The results agree with the results from\nsensitivity analysis that the inlet pressure to the \ufb01rst react or\nhas inversely proportional relationship with the methanol\nproductioncost.\nBy \ufb01tting data set 2 with the \ufb01rst\u2014order regression\nmodel, the data did not appropriately \ufb01t the model as R\u2014\nsquared value is 0.6353 ( <0.7). This means that there is\nhigh possibility to \ufb01nd the non-linear region at this step.\nWe then used theses ranges of operating condition with\nBBD in collecting more data for constructing the non-\nlinearmodel.\nThe Optimal Conditions\nThe reduced non-linear model (the model with only signi\ufb01cant\nterms) was constructed with 73 sample points (32 sample\npoints from 2kfactorial design, and 41 sample points from\nBBD) as shown in Equation (15).

The percent error of the model was estimated\nby comparing between the predicted methanol production\ncost with the actual production cost. We obtained the actual\nproduction cost by running the process simulation with the\ncorresponding optimal operating conditions. The percent error\nof this non-linear model is 1.05. For regression analysis of t his\nmodel, the R\u2014squared value is 0.8705, and the adjusted R\u2014\nsquared value is 0.8610. Therefore, with the small number of\npercenterror,itcanbeconcludedthatthismethanolproducti on\nvia CO 2hydrogenation process can be represented by the\nsecond order model. The process is successfully optimized\nusingRSM.\nThe optimization formulation was solved in the Intel\nPentium 4 processor, core i3. The local optimal solutions\nwere obtained in 2s. The obtained minimum production\ncost ($ per tons produced methanol) is an o\ufb00set between\nthe methanol production cost and the amount of produced\nmethanol. The methanol production cost includes energy\nconsumption, utilities, and capital cost costs. For the optima l\nsolution, the amount of produced methanol increased so that\nthe minimum production cost per tons of produced methanol\nwas obtained. The optimal methanol production rate is 964\nkmoles per hours, which produced from 1,000 kmoles per\nhour of feed carbon dioxide and 3,000 kmoles per hour of\nfeedhydrogen.CONCLUSION\nIn the optimization of methanol production via CO 2\nhydrogenation, the sensitivity analysis coupled with RSM\nwas successfully represent the relationship between methano l\nproduction operating conditions and the methanol production\ncostpertonsproducedmethanol($pertonproducedmethanol).\nThe non-linear solver was applied to optimize the non-linear\nrelationship model for the minimum methanol production cost.\nTwo reactors were employed in the process.

Detailed process simulations with heat integration and\ntechno-economic analyses of methanol synthesis from green H 2and captured CO 2are presented here,\ncomparing the proposed process with condensation steps with the conventional approach. In the new\nprocess, a CO 2single-pass conversion of 53.9% was achieved, which is signi\ufb01cantly higher than the\nconversion of the conventional process (28.5%) and its equilibrium conversion (30.4%). Consequently,\nthe total recycle stream \ufb02ow was halved, which reduced reactant losses in the purge stream and the\ncompression work of the recycle streams, lowering operating costs by 4.8% (61.2 M \u20ac\u00b7a\u22121). In spite of\nthe additional number of heat exchangers and \ufb02ash drums related to the intermediate condensation\nunits, the \ufb01xed investment costs of the improved process decreased by 22.7% (94.5 M \u20ac). This was a\nconsequence of the increased reaction rates and lower recycle \ufb02ows, reducing the required size of the\nmain equipment. Therefore, intermediate condensation steps are bene\ufb01cial for methanol synthesis\nfrom H 2/CO 2, signi\ufb01cantly boosting CO 2single-pass conversion, which consequently reduces both\nthe investment and operating costs.\nKeywords: methanol synthesis; CO 2utilization; power-to-X; intermediate condensation steps;\nproduct removal; techno-economic analysis; heat integration; plant simulation\n1. Introduction\nSustainable solutions are required to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the\ntransportation and industrial sectors, shrinking the dependency on fossil fuels. With the\ncontinuously increasing installed capacity of wind and solar power plants [ 1], adequate\nenergy storage solutions have to be implemented in order to deal with their \ufb02uctuating\nnature. Therefore, the conversion of electricity into valuable chemicals and fuels, a concept\noften called power-to-fuels or power-to-X, can make an important contribution to the\nfuture energy system [ 2]. In this context, key process steps are hydrogen generation via\nelectrolysis (primary conversion) [ 3,4] and methanol synthesis (secondary conversion) [ 5].\nMethanol can be used as a fuel substitute or additive, either in fuel cells or via\ncombustion [2] , as a feedstock in the production of base chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde)\nand liquid fuels (e.g., gasoline, oxymethylene ethers, jetfuel) [ 6\u20138], and also as a solvent.\nMethanol fuel has recently attracted signi\ufb01cant interest, especially in China, where the\nconsumption of methanol for thermal applications (e.g., boilers, kilns, cooking stoves) and\nin the transportation section amounted to 5.7 Mton \u00b7a\u22121(year 2019) [9].\nThe current global capacity of methanol production is 164 Mton \u00b7a\u22121(year 2021), with\nan annual increase of 10% projected for the next decade [ 10]. Traditionally, methanol\nsynthesis is fed by fossil-based syngas, which comes either from steam reforming of natural\ngas or from coal gasi\ufb01cation [ 11]. However, sustainable syngas production is gaining\nProcesses 2022 ,10, 1535. https://doi.org/10.3390/pr10081535 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/processesProcesses 2022 ,10, 1535 2 of 24\nimportance, such as from renewable electricity and captured CO 2, and also from biomass.\nIn Figure 1, a scheme is presented showing the intermediate position of methanol in the\nconversion of both fossil-based and sustainable syngas to added-value chemicals and fuels,\nas well as methanol end-use applications.\nProcesses 2022 , 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 26 \n \n (e.g., boilers, kilns, cooking stoves) and in the transportation section amounted to \n5.7 Mton\u00b7a\u22121 (year 2019) [9]. \nThe current global capacity of methanol production is 164 Mton\u00b7a\u22121 (year 2021), \nwith an annual increase of 10% projected for the next decade [10].

In Figure 1, a scheme is presented showing the \nintermediate position of methanol in the conversion of both fossil-based and \nsustainable syngas to added-value chemic als and fuels, as well as methanol end-\nuse applications. \n \nFigure 1. The key position of methanol to convert syngas sources into added-value chemicals \nand fuels. Icons from: Freepik, Flaticon [12] . \nThe current world-scale technology for me thanol synthesis is mostly based on \nthe application of Cu/ZnO/Al 2O3 (CZA) catalysts in either multi-tube reactors with \nboiling water as the cooling fluid, normally  called isothermal reactors (e.g., the \nLurgi process, the Linde process), or adia batic reactors with intermediate cold \nsyngas quenching, generally named quen ch reactors (e.g., ICI and the Casale \nprocess, the Haldor Topsoe process) [11,13]. Less common but also industrially \napplied are the adiabatic reactors with intermediate cooling (e.g., the Kellogg \nprocess, the Toyo process) [11,14]. Normally, temperatures between 200 and 300 \u00b0C \nand pressures between 50 and 100 bar are applied [13]. \nMethanol can be produced from either CO (Equation (1)) or CO 2 (Equation (2)), \nwith the reverse water\u2013gas shift reaction (rWGSR, Equation (3)) also occurring. If \nthe feed gas contains both CO and CO 2, there is a prevailing opinion that direct CO \nhydrogenation (Equation (1)) on Cu/Zn-based catalysts is significantly slower than \nCO 2 hydrogenation [15,16], and kinetic mode ls not considering this reaction can \nadequately simulate experimental data [17\u201319].  \nCO (\u0b65)+2\u2219H \u0b36(\u0b65)\u21c4C H \u0b37OH (\u0b65)             \u2206\ud835\udc3b\u0b36\u0b39 \u00b0\u0bbc\u0b34= \u221290.6 kJ \u2219 mol\u0b3f\u0b35 (1) \nFigure 1.

Although the\nimplementation of intermediate condensation steps is a promising strategy to increase\nmethanol yield from H 2/CO 2syngas, such an approach has still not received particular\nattention, and plant simulations with heat integration and techno-economic analyses are\nnot available in the literature yet, to the best of our knowledge.\nIn this work, the conventional approach (named here the \u2018one-step process\u2019) is com-\npared with a new alternative approach including two condensation steps (named here the\n\u2018three-step process\u2019). Using our recently developed kinetic model for methanol synthesis [19] ,\nboth processes were implemented in Matlab in order to critically analyze and select key\nprocess parameters (i.e., cooling \ufb02uid temperature, number of reactor modules, and purge\nfraction). With the optimized parameters, detailed methanol synthesis plants with heat inte-\ngration were implemented in Aspen Plus, and techno-economic analyses were performed.Processes 2022 ,10, 1535 4 of 24\n2. Methodology\n2.1. Process Overview\nIn the present work, a methanol synthesis plant from H 2/CO 2with a production of\n145 ton \u00b7h\u22121is considered. This value is based on an ongoing power-to-gasoline project\nvia H 2/CO 2conversion to methanol [ 26], whose \ufb01nal goal is a gasoline production of\n5.5\u00b7108L\u00b7a\u22121, which corresponds to a methanol production of 1.16 Mton \u00b7a\u22121or 145 ton \u00b7h\u22121\n(assuming a yield of 80% in the methanol-to-gasoline process and plant operating hours\nof 8000 h \u00b7a\u22121).\nIn our simulations, feed carbon dioxide comes from the cleaned \ufb02ue gas of nearby\nindustries (e.g., a cement industry) at 25\u25e6C and 1 bar, with a purity of 99.5% mol/mol (the\nrest was water). Feed hydrogen comes from water electrolysis at 25\u25e6C and 30 bar, with a\npurity of 99.5% mol/mol (the rest was nitrogen). Although it is possible to obtain these\nfeedstocks in an extremely high purity (e.g., 99.99% mol/mol) [ 31,32], we chose a more\nconservative scenario, which also allows a proper simulation of inert material accumulation\nin the plant.\nAs pressure has a signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence on the thermodynamic equilibrium of methanol\nsynthesis (see Figure 2), the reactor operating pressure was set to 70 bar. Although higher\npressures are reported to have potential in methanol synthesis [ 33,34], they were out\nof the scope of this work, since considerable extrapolations in the kinetic model would\nbe necessary, and condensation inside the reactor might have to be taken into account.\nBesides, higher pressures increase compression costs and might also require more expensive\nmaterials to build the equipment.\nThe dimensions of the reactor modules were chosen to be close to the upper size\nlimits that are currently commercially available. That is, each reactor module consisted of\na shell containing 33,000 tubes with 12.5 m length and an inner diameter of 3.75 cm.\nSince the heat generation in CO 2hydrogenation is lower than in CO hydrogenation\n(Equations (1) and (2)) , less heat transfer area is necessary. Because of that, the tube inner\ndiameter chosen in this work (3.75 cm) was larger than the size typically used for CO\nconversion to methanol (2.5 cm). Considering 1050 kg \u00b7m\u22123as the apparent catalyst bed\ndensity [ 35], the total CZA catalyst loading of each reactor module was 478.13 ton. A total\npressure loss of 0.75 bar was considered for each reactor module [36].\n2.1.1. One-Step Approach\u2014Process Description\nIn Figure 3, a detailed \ufb02owsheet of the one-step process is presented. This is an\nadapted version from a concept reported in the literature [ 37\u201339]. Feed CO 2is mixed\nwith a low-pressure recycle stream, and then compressed from 1 to 70 bar in a three-stage\nprocess, including intermediate cooling (reducing compression work) and intermediate\nphase separation (to remove condensed methanol and water from the recycle stream). The\nresulting compressed stream is mixed with feed H 2(compressed from 30 to 70 bar in one\nstage) and with a high pressure recycle stream. The mixed stream is preheated with the\nproduct gas and enters the inner tubes of parallel reactor modules, with the temperature\nbeing controlled by boiling water on the shell side.\nThe product stream is cooled down to 30\u25e6C in four heat exchangers, condensing\nwater, methanol, and some CO 2, which are separated from the light gases in a \ufb02ash drum.\nA fraction of the gas stream is purged, and the remaining stream is recompressed to 70 bar\nand recycled. The liquid stream from the \ufb02ash drum is depressurized to 1 bar and heated\nto30\u25e6C, vaporizing most remaining CO 2. A liquid\u2013gas separation is performed in another\n\ufb02ash drum. A fraction of the gas stream from the low-pressure \ufb02ash drum is purged, and\nthe rest is recycled by mixing with feed CO 2. The liquid stream from the low-pressure\n\ufb02ash drum is preheated and fed to a packed column, where methanol in high purity\n(>99.5% m/m ) is recovered in the liquid distillate, water is recovered in the bottom, and\nmost of the remaining CO 2is recovered in the gas distillate.Processes 2022 ,10, 1535 5 of 24\nProcesses 2022 , 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 26 \n \n parallel reactor modules, with the temper ature being controlled by boiling water \non the shell side. \n \nFigure 3.

The liquid stream from the flash \ndrum is depressurized to 1 bar and heated  to 30 \u00b0C, vaporizing most remaining \nCO\n2. A liquid\u2013gas separation is performed in  another flash drum.

The \nheat of reaction of both the purge combustion and the methanol synthesis are used in a water Rankine cycle to produce electricity. The cycle starts with liquid water at 1 bar and 99.6 \u00b0C being pumped to a certain pressure, whose boiling temperature corresponds to the desired reactor temperature. Pressurized water reaches its boiling temperature in two steps (heat ex changer and fired heater) and vaporizes \ninside the reactor modules.

Process Simulation in Matlab\nBefore implementing the \ufb01nal version of each plant in Aspen Plus, different scenarios\nwere investigated in Matlab. Therefore, optimal key parameters were selected, such as the\ntotal number of reactor modules, the purge fraction, and the temperature of the cooling\n\ufb02uid in the reactor.\nIn order to simulate the reactor, the following considerations were made: there are only\nvariations along the length of the reactor (1D assumption), the in\ufb02uence of back-mixing is\nneglected (plug \ufb02ow assumption), and the cooling \ufb02uid temperature ( Tw, in K) is constant.\nStarting from mass and energy balances, the differential equations of the total mole \ufb02ow of\na single tube (.n, in mol \u00b7s\u22121), the mole fraction of each component j(yj), and the temperature\n(T, in K) in the axial direction zare shown as follows:\nd.n\ndz=mCat\nL\u00b76\n\u2211\nj=12\n\u2211\nk=1(\u03bdjk\u00b7rk) (4)\ndyj\ndz=1\n.n\u00b7{\nmCat\nL\u00b72\n\u2211\nk=1(\u03bdjk\u00b7rk)\u2212yj\u00b7d.n\ndz}\n(5)\ndT\ndz=1(.n\u00b7CP,f)\u00b7[\n\u2212d.n\ndz\u00b7hf\u2212.n\u00b76\n\u2211\nj=1(\nhj\u00b7dyj\ndz)\n+U\u00b7\u03c0\u00b7Di\u00b7(Tw\u2212T)]\n(6)\nwhere mCatis the catalyst mass (kg), Lis the reactor length (m), yjkis the stoichiometric\ncoef\ufb01cient of component jin reaction k,rkis the rate of reaction k(mol\u00b7kgcat\u00b7s\u22121),CP,fis the\nheat capacity of the \ufb02uid (J \u00b7mol\u00b7K\u22121),hfis the speci\ufb01c enthalpy of the \ufb02uid (J \u00b7mol\u22121),hjis\nthe speci\ufb01c enthalpy of component j,Uis the global heat transfer coef\ufb01cient (W \u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121),\nand Diis the inner diameter of a single tube (m).\nThe temperature-dependent parameters ( CP,f,hf,hj,U) were updated in each in-\ntegration point in the axial direction. Heat capacity and enthalpy were calculated with\nthe thermodynamic functions provided by Goos et al. [ 41], which are detailed in the\nSupplementary Material (Section A) along with the derivation of the differential equations.\nThe global heat transfer coef\ufb01cient was estimated ( U) by summing the heat transfer resis-\ntances in the axial direction, according to the methodology described in the literature [ 42,43]\n(see Section B of the Supplementary Material).\nThe methodology to calculate the reaction rates ( rk) is described in Section 2.3. The\nsystem of differential equations was solved with the Matlab function ode45, with absolute\nand relative tolerances set to 10\u221210.\nIn order to simplify the simulation of the separation steps in Matlab, the following\nprocedure was applied. Both processes were implemented in Aspen Plus, considering a\ntotal of six reactor modules, a purge fraction of 2%, and Tw= 235\u25e6C. The values of the split\nratio of each component in the liquid and gas phase of each \ufb02ash drum and the distillation\ncolumn were extracted. For example, in the column of the one-step process, the methanol\ndistribution in the outlet streams was: 3.80% in the gas distillate, 96.13% in the liquid\ndistillate, and 0.06% in the bottom. The split ratio of all the components were taken from\nAspen Plus and were considered constant for the different scenarios investigated in Matlab\n(i.e., variations in the number of reactor modules, purge fraction, and Tw). These split ratios\nare provided in the Supplementary Material (Section C).\nFlowsheet convergence was achieved in Matlab by an iterative method, as there were\ntwo cycles of streams due to recycling unconverted reactants. First, educated initial guesses\nof the composition and total mole \ufb02ow of each recycle stream were given. In each iteration,\nthe recycle stream mole \ufb02ow and its composition were calculated and used in the next\niteration until the tolerance criterion was ful\ufb01lled:Processes 2022 ,10, 1535 8 of 24\n(.nRe f,k+1\u2212.nRe f,k)2\n(.nRe f,k+1)2\u2264Tolerance (7)\nwhere.nRe f,kis the total mole \ufb02ow of the recycle stream at iteration k. The tolerance of the\ninner cycle and the outer cycle were set to 10\u22129and 10\u22128, respectively.\n2.3. Kinetic Modeling of the Methanol Synthesis\nThe kinetic simulation of the methanol synthesis was performed with our previously\npublished six-parameter model (Model-6p) [ 19], whose considerations regarding the reac-\ntion mechanism, the assumption of the rate determining steps, and the most abundant sur-\nface species were based on our detailed microkinetic model [ 15]. This six-parameter model\nwas validated with 496 experimental points from different laboratory plants [ 15,18,44],\nwhich contemplated temperatures between 210 and 260\u25e6C, pressures between 20 and 60 bar,\ngas hourly space velocities (GHSV) between 1.8 and 40 L S\u00b7h\u22121\u00b7gcat\u22121, and a variety of\nsyngas (H 2/CO/CO 2/N2) feed compositions, including 126 points with only H 2/CO 2/N2\nin feed.\nIn this model, two main reactions are considered: CO 2hydrogenation (Equation (2))\nand the rWGSR (Equation (3)). The reaction rates ( rCO2hyd.,rrWGSR ) in mol \u00b7kgcat\u22121\u00b7s\u22121are\ndescribed as follows:\nrCO2hyd.=exp(\nA2\u2212EA,2\nR\u00b7T)\n\u00b7\u03c6Zn\u00b7\u03b8b\u00b7\u03b8c\u00b7f1.5\nH2\u00b7fCO2\u00b7(\n1\u2212fCH 3OH\u00b7fH2O\nf3\nH2\u00b7fCO2\u00b7K0\nP,CO2hyd.)\n(8)\nrrWGSR =exp(\nA3\u2212EA,3\nR\u00b7T)\n\u00b7\u03c6Zn\u00b7\u03b8b\u00b7\u03b8c\u00b7fCO2\u00b7fH2O\u00b7(\n1\u2212fCO\u00b7fH2O\nfH2\u00b7fCO2\u00b7K0\nP,rWGSR)\n(9)\nHere, A2\u22123and EA,2\u22123are kinetic parameters, Ris the universal gas constant, \u03c6Znis\nthe zinc coverage on the surface, \u03b8band\u03b8care the free active sites b and c, fjis the fugacity\nof gas component j(bar), and K0\nP,kis the global equilibrium constant of reaction k.\nThe Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state is used to calculate the fugacities [ 45], consider-\ning the binary interaction parameters reported by Meng et al. [ 46] and Meng and Duan [ 47],\nand an effective hydrogen acentric factor of \u22120.05 proposed by Deiters et al. [48].\nThe zinc coverage is dependent on temperature and gas concentration [ 49], and its\nexact quanti\ufb01cation under reaction conditions is dif\ufb01cult to predict. The zinc coverage is\nthen considered to be constant and equal to \u03c6Zn= 0.50 for a general case, while it is set to\n\u03c6Zn= 0.10 for CO 2-rich feed (CO 2/CO x> 0.90). The free active sites are calculated with the\nfollowing equations:\n\u03b8b=(\nK2\u00b7f0.5\nH2\u00b7fCO2+1)\u22121\n(10)\n\u03b8c=(\nK3\u00b7f\u22120.5\nH2\u00b7fH2O+1)\u22121\n(11)\nwhere K2\u22123are adsorption parameters. In Table 1, the equilibrium constants as well as the\npreviously estimated kinetic and adsorption parameters are summarized [19].\nThe side products of methanol synthesis on Cu/Zn-based catalysts (e.g., hydrocarbons\nor dimethyl ether) are typically at low concentrations [ 13,50]. Several studies reported that\nsyngas conversion to hydrocarbons or dimethyl ether on commercial CZA at moderate\ntemperatures (T \u2264260\u25e6C) is signi\ufb01cantly low or even below detection range [ 15,18,44],\nwhile Condero-Lanzac et al. [ 22] reported low methane production from H 2/CO 2on CZA\nat high temperatures (T \u2265275\u25e6C). Saito et al. [ 51] observed that side product formation is\nfurther reduced by increasing CO 2/CO Xfeed concentration. Therefore, the generation of\nside products is not considered in this work.Processes 2022 ,10, 1535 9 of 24\nTable 1. Equilibrium constants, kinetic and adsorption parameters of Model-6p [ 19].

Process Analysis and Optimization\nConsidering the \ufb01xed methanol production of 145 ton \u00b7h\u22121or 1257.1 mol \u00b7s\u22121and the\n99.5% mol/mol purity of the reactants, the minimum required feed is 1263.4 mol \u00b7s\u22121of\nCO 2and 3790.3 mol \u00b7s\u22121of H 2, totalizing.nf eed,min= 5053.7 mol \u00b7s\u22121. Since there are reactant\nlosses in the purge and product streams, an excess of feed is required. With a \ufb01x feed ratio\nH2:CO 2of 3:1, the excess of feed ( Exc) is de\ufb01ned here as:\nExc=(.nf eed\u2212.nf eed,min)\n.nf eed,min\u00b7100% (12)\nIt is, of course, of interest to minimize feed consumption, due to its high costs. Feed\nconsumption is affected by key variables, such as reactor temperature and pressure, the\nnumber of reactor modules (which de\ufb01nes the total catalyst mass), and purge fraction.\nAvoiding large recycle streams is also important, as compressor work is required to get\nthe pressure back to 70 bar, and larger equipment (i.e., heat exchangers, \ufb02ash drums,\ncompressors) are required to process higher \ufb02ows.\nSimulations were performed for a different number of reactor modules (from 3 to 12)\nand different purge fractions (from 0.5 to 5%). For each case, an initial guess for the feed\nexcess was given ( Exc= 5%), and a \ufb01x feed ratio H 2:CO 2of 3:1 (a stoichiometric ratio) was\napplied. Then, an optimization problem was solved in Matlab with the function fminsearch\n(function tolerance = 0.1 mol \u00b7s\u22121, step tolerance = 0.1\u25e6C), whose objective was to maximize\nmethanol production by varying the reactor coolant temperature ( Tw).\nWith the optimum Tw, the required excess of feed was calculated to meet the methanol\ndemand (1257.1 mol \u00b7s\u22121) with Newton\u2019s method (function tolerance: 0.1 mol \u00b7s\u22121). The\nsteps of the temperature optimization and Exccalculations were repeated until the temper-\nature update was lower than 0.25\u25e6C.\n2.5. Detailed Plant Simulation in Aspen Plus\nAfter analyzing the results of the Matlab simulations, optimum parameters were\nselected for each approach (i.e., the number of reactor modules, purge fraction, cooling \ufb02uid\ntemperature) and a detailed plant simulation including heat integration was implemented\nin Aspen Plus V10.\nThe Peng\u2013Robinson property method was selected for the reactor modules. All other\nequipment were simulated with the Non-Random Two-Liquid Model with a second set of\nbinary parameters (NRTL2) as the property method.\nThe methanol synthesis reactor was simulated with the rigorous plug \ufb02ow reactor\nmodel (RPLUG unit) and the kinetics described in Section 2.3 were implemented as a\nLangmuir\u2013Hinshelwood\u2013Hougen\u2013Watson (LHHW) reaction model. The rearrangement\nof the model parameters to follow the software\u2019s speci\ufb01c input format is detailed in the\nSupplementary Material (Section D). Since the reactor cooling \ufb02uid is at a constant tem-\nperature due to water evaporation, both co-current and counter-current operations giveProcesses 2022 ,10, 1535 10 of 24\nthe same results. Therefore, the co-current operation was selected in order to simplify the\nmathematical calculations.\nThe combustion of the purge streams in a \ufb01red heater was simulated with the RGIBBS\nunit, which considers that chemical equilibrium is achieved when the free Gibbs energy of\nthe system is minimized.\nThe heat exchangers were simulated in counter-current \ufb02ow with the HeatX unit, with\na minimum temperature approach of 25\u25e6C for the heat exchangers located inside the \ufb01red\nheater and a minimum temperature approach of 10\u25e6C for all the other heat exchangers.\nThe compressors were modeled using the ASME method, assuming a mechanical\nef\ufb01ciency of 0.95 and an isentropic ef\ufb01ciency of 0.80 [ 22]. The pump was simulated assum-\ning an ef\ufb01ciency of 0.70. The turbine was simulated with the ASME method, assuming a\nmechanical ef\ufb01ciency of 0.95 and an isentropic ef\ufb01ciency of 0.90 [52].\nThe distillation column was simulated with the rigorous RadFrac model, considering a\nkettle reboiler and a partial condenser at 53\u25e6C with liquid and vapor distillate. A Murphree\nef\ufb01ciency of 0.75 was set to all intermediate stages [ 53,54]. In both processes, the column\nhad 30 stages and a re\ufb02ux ratio of 2, with the feed entering above the 24th stage.\nThe relative tolerance of all equipment calculations was set to 10\u22125. Flowsheet conver-\ngence was achieved using the Broyden method, with a relative tolerance of 10\u22124, which\ncorresponds to a mass balance closure of 99.99%.\n2.6. Ef\ufb01ciency Evaluation\nThe chemical conversion ef\ufb01ciency ( \u03b7CCE) accounts for how much fuel energy remains\nin the \ufb01nal product in relation to the reactants. For methanol synthesis from H 2/CO 2, it is\ncalculated as follows: [55]\n\u03b7CCE=.mMeOH\u00b7LHV MeOH.mH2\u00b7LHV H2(13)\nwhere.mMeOH is the methanol mass production,.mH2is the hydrogen feed demand, and\nLHV is the low heating value. The maximum possible ef\ufb01ciency ( \u03b7CCE ,max) occurs at 100%\noverall H 2conversion to methanol (stoichiometric conversion):\n\u03b7CCE ,max=MMeOH\u00b7LHV MeOH\n3\u00b7MH2\u00b7LHV H2=0.876 (14)\nHere, Mjis the molar mass of component j. In order to also account for heat and the\nwork input, the exergy ef\ufb01ciency ( \u03b7Ex) is calculated: [39]\n\u03b7Ex=.mMeOH\u00b7eMeOH.mH2\u00b7eH2+.mCO2\u00b7eCO2+Pel+EQ(15)\nwhere ejis the speci\ufb01c exergy of component j,Pelis the total required electric power, and\nEQis the total exergy input associated with heat demand.\nThe specific exergy of a component ( ej) is divided between thermal and chemical exergy: [ 39]\nej(T,p)=[\nej,therm]\n+ej,chem=[\nHj\u2212Sj\u00b7T0\u2212H0\nj+S0\nj\u00b7T0]\n+HHV j (16)\nHere, ej,therm and ej,chem are the thermal and chemical exergies, Hjis enthalpy, Sjis\nentropy, H0\njand S0\njare the enthalpy and entropy at reference conditions (298.15 K and 1 bar),\nT0is the reference temperature, and HHV jis the high heating value. In the exergy ef\ufb01ciency\ncalculation, the HHV is used instead of the LHV , as water is liquid at reference conditions.\n2.7. Techno-Economic Evaluation\nIn order to calculate the production costs, the standardized methodology from\nAlbrecht et al. [56] was considered, which is a further development based on the work\nof Peters et al. [57].Processes 2022 ,10, 1535 11 of 24\nThe main equipment costs ( EC) were estimated based on reference equipment costs [57,58].\nThe scale up to the required capacity was performed with speci\ufb01c equipment scaling factors,\nand price in\ufb02ation was corrected to 2020 with the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Indexes\n(CEPCI ). In Equation (23), the costs of equipment j(ECj) is described:\nECj=ECj,re f\u00b7(\nCj\nCj,re f)M\n\u00b7(\nCEPCI 2020\nCEPCI re f)\n(17)\nHere, the subscription ref relates to the reference equipment, Cis the characteristic\ncapacity, and Mis the equipment scaling factor. The equipment is constructed with carbon\nsteel. When the reference price is in US dollars (USD), a conversion to euros (EUR) of\n1.13 USD \u00b7EUR\u22121is applied (February 2022) [59].\nThe dimensions of the flash drums and the packed distillation column were calculated\nwith the methodology reported by Towler and Sinnott [ 60]. The required heat transfer area of\nthe heat exchangers, column condenser, and reboiler were estimated by assuming the typical\nglobal heat transfer coefficients reported by the VDI Atlas [ 43], according to each specific\nsituation. Equipment dimensioning is detailed in the Supplementary Material (Section G).\nThe \ufb01xed capital investment ( FCI) was estimated by multiplying the total EC with the\nLang Factor ( LF), which accounts for all direct and indirect costs related to the plant\nconstruction. In this work, LFwas assumed to be 4.86 (details are provided in the\nSupplementary Material, Section H) [56,57] . A working capital ( WC) of 10% of the total\ncapital expenses ( CAPEX ) was considered [56]. Summarizing the equations:\nFCI=LF\u00b7\u2211ECj (18)\nCAPEX =FCI+WC (19)\nWC=0.10\u00b7CAPEX (20)\nThe equivalent annual capital costs ( ACC ) were estimated by applying the annuity\nmethod on the FCI, assuming an annual interest rate ( IR) of 10%, a plant operating life ( tP)\nof 20 years, and no salvage value [ 61]. The working capital does not depreciate in value,\nand only its interest has to be taken into account [56].\nACC FCI=FCI\u00b7IR\u00b7(1+IR)tP\n[(1+IR)tP\u22121](21)\nACC WC=WC\u00b7IR (22)\nACC =ACC FCI+ACC WC=FCI\u00b7IR\u00b7(1+IR)tP\n[(1+IR)tP\u22121]+WC\u00b7IR (23)\nThe operating expenses ( OPEX ) were divided between direct and indirect costs. The\ncosts related to the direct OPEX ( OPEX dir) are presented in Table 2, which include raw\nmaterials, catalysts, process water treating, and electricity. A catalyst lifetime of three years\nwas considered. In the Rankine water cycle, a clean water replacement of 1% of the total\n\ufb02ow was considered [62].\nThe indirect OPEX consisted of operating labor ( OL), operating supervision, mainte-\nnance, operating supplies, laboratory charges, taxes on property, insurance, plant overhead,\nadministration, distribution, marketing, research, and development. The estimation of each\nof these items was based on typical values, which are dependent on OL,FCI, and the net\nproduction costs ( NPC ) (see Section H of the Supplementary Material) [ 56,57]. The total\nindirect OPEX (OPEX ind) is calculated as follows:\nOPEX ind=2.2125\u00b7OL+0.081\u00b7FCI+0.10\u00b7NPC (24)Processes 2022 ,10, 1535 12 of 24\nTable 2.

Results and Discussion\nIn this section, process simulation and analysis are presented separately for the one-\nstep and the three-step approaches. Finally, the techno-economic analysis of both ap-\nproaches is presented and discussed jointly.\n3.1. One-Step Process\n3.1.1. One-Step Process\u2014Selecting Key Parameters\nThe one-step process was successfully implemented in Matlab. Different scenarios\nwere simulated by varying the number of reactor modules and the purge fraction, with\nthe optimal temperature for a \ufb01xed methanol production (145 ton \u00b7h\u22121) being estimated\nin each case. In Figure 5, several contour plots are shown, where CO 2single-pass conver-\nsion ( XCO2,SP) (Figure 5a), the required feed excess (Figure 5b), the optimal temperature\n(Figure 5c), and the total recycle stream (Figure 5d) are plotted against the number of reactor\nmodules and the purge fraction.\nCO 2single-pass conversion (Figure 5a) was considerably enhanced by increasing\nthe number of reactor modules. This was not only because the gas hourly space velocity\n(GHSV) decreased, but also because the optimal temperature had lower values (Figure 5c),\nshifting the thermodynamic equilibrium towards higher methanol concentrations. In\ncontrast, reducing the purge fraction had little effect on XCO2,SP. This should be the result\nof two competing effects: on one hand, a lower purge fraction means higher recycle\nstreams (Figure 5d), which increases the GHSV , reducing XCO2,SP. On the other hand, the\nrecycle stream has a H 2:CO 2ratio greater than three due to a limited rWGSR extension.Processes 2022 ,10, 1535 13 of 24\nBy increasing the recycle stream, the H 2:CO 2ratio of the reactor feed stream is enhanced,\npositively contributing to XCO2,SP.\nProcesses 2022 , 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 26 \n \n  \nFigure 5.

One-Step Process\u2014 Detailed Plant Simulation and Process Analysis \nA detailed flowsheet of the one-step proce ss presented in Figure 3 was implemented \nin Aspen Plus, considering 2% purge fraction, six reactor modules working in parallel, \nand the optimized temperature of  the reactor cooling fluid ( \ud835\udc47\u0bea = 247.5 \u00b0C). A picture of \nthe flowsheet in Aspen Plus, the properties of  the streams, and a detailed plant description \nare provided in the Supplemen tary Material (Section E). \nIn Figure 6, the concentration of the products along the reactor length is shown. The \nmethanol and water feed concentrations were cl ose to zero, and their outlet concentrations \nwere 7.4 and 7.2% mol/mol, respectively. The nitrogen concentration remained relatively \nlow (inlet: 4.95% mol/mol, outlet: 5.65% mol/mol). Due to the recycle streams, CO entered \nthe reactor modules at 1.50% mol/mol, although it was not a feedstock in the plant. CO \nwas produced through the rWGSR until the le ngth of 1.5 m, where its concentration \nreached 3.3% mol/mol. Then, due to the high  water concentration (4.30% mol/mol), the \nWGSR became faster than its reverse reacti on and started to consume CO, which exited \nthe reactor at 1.76% mol/mol and a marginal selectivity (0.5%). This virtually stabilized \nCO content in the plant led to a high methanol selectivity (99.5%). \nFigure 5. One-step process\u2014CO 2single-pass conversion ( a), required feed excess ( b), optimal\ntemperature ( c), and total recycle stream ( d) as a function of the number of reactor modules and the\npurge fraction.\nThe required feed excess was signi\ufb01cantly decreased both by increasing the number\nof reactor modules and by reducing the purge fraction. This occurred because the former\nprocedure increased XCO2,SPand the latter maintained XCO2,SProughly constant while\nincreasing the gas \ufb02ow inside the reactor modules.\nSince the reactants (H 2, CO 2) represent the highest costs of the plant, it is important to\nminimize the required feed excess, which according to Figure 5b, occurred at 0.5% purge\nfraction. However, with such a low purge fraction, the total recycle stream was considerably\nhigh, demanding larger heat exchangers, \ufb02ash drums, and compressors, as well as higher\npower consumption. Therefore, an intermediate value of 2% as the purge fraction was\nselected for the detailed simulation in Aspen Plus, agreeing with other studies and typical\nindustrial values [22,39,58].\nWith the purge fraction \ufb01xed at 2%, six reactor modules were used in the detailed\nstudy, because further increasing the number of reactor modules only slightly reduced the\nrequired excess feed, not justifying further expenses in equipment and catalyst.\nThe value of the global heat transfer coefficient was updated point by point within mathe-\nmatical integration along the reactor length. For the selected condition, Uz=0= 160 W \u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121Processes 2022 ,10, 1535 14 of 24\nand Uz=12.5= 150 W \u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121. Since Aspen Plus requires a constant value, the average\nvalue was used ( Uavg= 155 W \u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121).\n3.1.2.

For similar conditions (i.e., the same total number of reactor modules and purge\nstream fraction), CO 2single-pass conversion had approximately doubled, the required\nfeed excess decreased by 60\u201370%, and the total recycle stream decreased by 50\u201370%. The\noptimal values for the reactor cooling \ufb02uid remained close to the ones of the \ufb01rst approach\n(between 230 and 260\u25e6C).\nSimilarly to the one-step process, a purge fraction equal to 2% was chosen here, having\na good compromise between minimizing the feed requirements and minimizing the total\nrecycle stream. With this \ufb01xed purge fraction, a number of reactor modules equal to three\nwas selected, as further increasing this amount gave limited improvement in the required\nfeed excess and the total recycle stream, while considerably increasing equipment and\ncatalyst costs.\nWhen analyzing different scenarios in Matlab, the same cooling \ufb02uid temperature\n(Tw) was considered for all reactors. A further optimization was possible by allowing this\ntemperature to be independently operated in each reactor. This possibility was checked\nfor the chosen condition (2% purge fraction, three reactor modules), but only a marginal\nimprovement was obtained (see Table 3), probably not justifying the increase in plant\ncomplexity. Therefore, in the detailed analysis, the cooling \ufb02uid temperature of all the\nreactors was set to 258.5\u25e6C.\nTable 3.

The decrease in the coef\ufb01cient values is associated with a decrease\nin total \ufb02ow, due to intermediate product removal. Still, the heat transfer coef\ufb01cients were\nhigher than in the one-step process (155 W \u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121), which had lower \ufb02ows for each\nreactor module because of parallel operation.\n3.2.2. Three-Step Process\u2014Detailed Plant Simulation and Process Analysis\nA detailed \ufb02owsheet of the three-step process presented in Figure 4 was implemented\nin Aspen Plus, considering a 2% purge fraction, three reactor modules working in series\nwith intermediate product condensation, and the previously optimized temperature of the\nreactor cooling \ufb02uid ( Tw= 258.5\u25e6C). A detailed plant description, stream properties, and a\npicture of the flowsheet in Aspen Plus are provided in the Supplementary Material (Section F).\nIn Figure 9, the concentration of the products along the length of the three reactors is\nshown, as well as the product removal through the intermediate condensation steps. In\nReactor 1, CO entered at a low concentration (1.3% mol/mol), peaked at z= 2.5 m, and\nleft the reactor with a higher concentration (2.7% mol/mol).

Conclusions \nA detailed study of a methanol synthesis plant from H 2 and CO 2 with intermediate \ncondensation units (the three-step process) is presented and compared with the \nconventional approach (the one-step process). The total production was fixed at 1.16 Mton \nMeOH\u00b7a\u22121. The processes were first implemented in Matlab in order to critically analyze \nthe number of reactor modules, the purge frac tion, and the reactor operating temperature. \nUsing the most suitable process parameters, detailed plants of both approaches were \nimplemented in Aspen Plus, including heat integration and a water Rankine cycle to make \nuse of the reaction enthalpy. Finally, tec hno-economic analyses were applied. Both \nprocesses offered an excess of heat, which was used to generate electricity in our work, but could alternatively supply other plants (e .g., CCU, OME synthesis) in a larger process \nintegration. \nIt was demonstrated that CO\n2 single-pass conversion almo st doubled when including \nintermediate condensation steps (53.9 vs. 28.5%), resulting in a significantly higher overall \nconversion to methanol (97.7 vs. 94.3%) and in  a higher exergy efficiency (78.8 vs. 76.4%). \nBecause of the enhanced conversion, the new process required lower recycle and feed \nstreams, decreasing net production costs by 61.2 M\u20ac\u00b7a\u22121 (5.7%). Although additional \nequipment (i.e., heat exchangers and gas\u2013liqu id separators) is necessary, the improved \nprocess was significantly more efficient than  the conventional approach, requiring lower \nsizes of the main equipment (e.g., compresso rs, reactors, fired heater). Consequently, \naccording to our analysis, the total investment costs were 94.5 M\u20ac (22.7%) lower than for \nthe conventional process. \nIntermediate condensation steps are therefore highly recommended for methanol \nproduction from H 2/CO 2, reducing costs by improving CO 2 equilibrium conversion to \nmethanol while using commercially proven technology. Besides, since water accelerates the deactivation of Cu-based catalysts, pr oduct intermediate removal should increase \ncatalyst lifetime, as the average water concentration in the reactor is significantly lower \nthan in the conventional process. \nWith our proposed process, the methanol  net production costs amounted to 868 \n\u20ac\u00b7ton\n\u22121, which are still significantly higher than the current market price (495 \u20ac\u00b7ton\u22121) but \nis believed to become economically viable with an effective reduction in the price of green \nhydrogen. \nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: \nwww.mdpi.com/xxx/s1, Figu re S1: One-step process\u2014Aspen Plus  flowsheet; Figure S2: Three-step \nprocess\u2014Aspen Plus flowsheet; Table S1: Parameters for the estimation of the specific heat capacity 0 1000 2000 3000 4000025050075010001250Net production costs (\u20ac\u00b7ton-1) \nGreen hydrogen price (\u20ac\u00b7ton-1) One-Step\n Three-Step  Current methanol\n    market price Current green    H\n2 price \nFigure 13.

In this study, we measured the near-surface dissolved concentrations of  CH4 and  CO2 \nfrom 40 lakes in the Alpine area to estimate their potential for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We hypothesized (1) a temperature-driven gradient of dissolved gas concentrations in terms of elevation and latitude of the lakes and (2) that lower concentrations would be measured in man-made reservoirs compared to natural lakes. Average  CH\n4 and  CO2 surface \ndissolved concentrations amounted to 1.10 \u00b1 1.30 and 36.23 \u00b1 31.15\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121, respectively. All the lakes, except for one, \nwere supersaturated, exceeding ambient atmospheric  CH4 and  CO2 concentrations by a factor of 400 \u00b1 424 and 2.43 \u00b1 2.29, \nrespectively. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found lower surface dissolved GHG concentrations in man-made reservoirs \ncompared to natural lakes, which was shown to be related to their greater depth. Even though temperature is known to affect multiple physico-chemical and biological processes governing the strength of the uptake, release and conversion of  CH\n4 and \n CO2, and temperature is inversely related to elevation, no relationship between dissolved GHG concentrations and elevation \ncould be determined. This is believed to be the result of the overriding importance of lake depth for near-surface  CH4 con-\ncentrations and the lack of explanatory variables related to lake carbon cycling. Overall, this study suggests that lakes in the Alpine region act as sources of  CO\n2 and  CH4 to the atmosphere and that further research should be carried out to quantify the \nactual GHG emissions from Alpine freshwater bodies and how these are affected by ongoing changes in climate and land use.\nKeywords Greenhouse gases\u00a0\u00b7 Freshwater\u00a0\u00b7 Methane\u00a0\u00b7 Carbon dioxide\u00a0\u00b7 Dissolved concentration\u00a0\u00b7 Emissions\nIntroduction\nCarbon dioxide  (CO2) and methane  (CH4) are the most \nstudied greenhouse gases (GHG) due to their global warm-\ning potential and their recent concentration increase in the atmosphere (Ciais et\u00a0al. 2013). The largest natural sources for  CO\n2 are the ocean, terrestrial plant respiration and \norganic matter decomposition and its main anthropogenic source are industrial activities, whereas  CH\n4 emissions come \nfrom anthropogenic activities and wetlands are considered as main natural emitters for  CH\n4 (Ciais et\u00a0al. 2013).\nUntil recently, inland waters (lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) \nwere not integrated into the carbon budget. A re-evaluation \nof the surface area of lakes (Downing et\u00a0al. 2006 ), reser -\nvoirs and small ponds showed that these inland waters cover more than 3% of Earth\u2019s surface, which is twice as high as previous estimates. Cole et\u00a0al. ( 2007) showed that, despite \ntheir small surface area, freshwaters were receiving as much \nElectronic supplementary material The online version of this \narticle (https ://doi.org/10.1007/s0002 7-018-0583-2) contains \nsupplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n * Sylvie Pighini \n sylvie.pighini@gmail.com\n Georg Wohlfahrt \n georg.wohlfahrt@uibk.ac.at\n1 Fondazione Edmund Mach, San\u00a0Michele\u00a0all\u2019 Adige, TN, Italy\n2 Institute of\u00a0Ecology, University of\u00a0Innsbruck, Innsbruck, \nAustria\n3 Faculty of\u00a0Science and\u00a0Technology, Free University of\u00a0Bolzano, Bolzano, BZ, Italy\n4 Istituto di Biometeorologia, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Florence, FI, Italy\n5 FOXLAB, Joint Research Initiative FEM-CNR, San\u00a0Michele\u00a0all\u2019 Adige, TN, ItalyAquatic Sciences S.\u00a0Pighini et al.\n1 3 32 Page 2 of 13\ncarbon as the ocean making them not only \u201cpipes\u201d trans-\nporting carbon from land to oceans, but also \u201creactors\u201d, transforming terrestrial (allochthonous) carbon. Tranvik et\u00a0al. (2009) re-estimated the \u201cactive pipes\u201d from Cole et\u00a0al. (2007) and evaluated that about 48.3% of this carbon is \nreleased to the atmosphere as  CO\n2, whereas 20.7% is buried \nin the sediments, mainly by lakes, reservoirs and wetlands and the remaining 31% is directed towards the oceans by riv -\ners and ground waters. Bastviken et\u00a0al. (2011) were able to establish a global estimation of  CH\n4 emissions, where 61.2% \nwere emitted as ebullition, 11% as diffusive fluxes, and the remaining 27.8% was stored in the systems.\nPrevious studies on greenhouse gases emissions from \nfreshwaters were mainly focused on tropical reservoirs, and showed that these were significant  CH\n4 emitters, through \ndiffusion and bubbling emissions (Abril et\u00a0al. 2005; Borges et\u00a0al. 2011). Boreal lakes were also found to be significant \nemitters of  CH\n4 and  CO2 (Huttunen et\u00a0al. 2003). In temper -\nate regions, and particularly the Alpine area, few studies on dissolved concentrations and emissions of GHG have been done so far, and were mainly focused on hydropower reservoirs (Del Sontro et\u00a0al. 2010; Diem et\u00a0al. 2012). The general scarcity of data, in particular for natural lakes, makes generalizations of GHG emissions from lakes in the Alpine area highly uncertain. Because of the technical difficulties associated with direct measurements of the lake-atmosphere GHG exchange across a large number of lakes and effort needed, the near-surface water dissolved GHG concentra-tions, is usually used as a proxy for the lake GHG emission potential (Schilder et\u00a0al. 2013).\nThe overarching aim of the present study is to therefore \nimprove the knowledge of the potential of Alpine lakes to act as sources for GHG. As direct measurements of the lake-atmosphere GHG exchange across a larger number of lakes representative of the Alpine area are very time consuming, we decided to quantify the near-surface water dissolved GHG concentrations, which can be considered a proxy for the lake emission potential (Schilder et\u00a0al. 2013). More spe-cifically, we aimed to (1) quantify near-surface dissolved concentrations of  CH\n4 and  CO2 from 40 natural and man-\nmade lakes over an elevation and a latitudinal transect across the Eastern Alps from the Trentino (Italy), South Tyrol (Italy) and North Tyrol (Austria) regions, and to (2) inves-tigate whether a statistical model predicting  CH\n4 and  CO2 \nsurface dissolved concentrations can be developed based on readily available lake characteristics.\nThe Alpine region is characterized by narrow valleys \nthat allow the construction of numerous reservoirs at higher elevations for electricity production, that result in deep and large lakes with smaller and less productive catchments com-pared to lower elevations, in this way, reducing the alloch-thonous input (Diem et\u00a0al. 2012). We thus hypothesized (H1) to observe less dissolved GHGs and as a consequence fewer emissions in higher-elevation reservoirs, compared to lower-elevation natural lakes in the Alpine area.\nWater temperature is a key abiotic parameter known to \naffect multiple physico-chemical and biological processes governing the strength of the uptake, release, and conversion of GHG. We thus hypothesized (H2) that dissolved GHG concentrations would increase with surface water tempera-ture (Yvon-Durocher et\u00a0al. 2014) and therefore, we expected a decrease of dissolved  CH\n4 concentrations with lake eleva-\ntion and latitude.\nMaterials and\u00a0methods\nStudy sites\nWe selected a set of 40 lakes in Trentino (Italy), South Tyrol (Italy), and North Tyrol (Austria) (Table\u00a0 1, Fig.\u00a0 1) distrib-\nuted along gradients of latitude, from 45.52\u00b0 to 47.38\u00b0, lon -\ngitude from 10.31\u00b0 to 12.34\u00b0, and elevation, from 240\u00a0m above sea level (a.s.l.) to 1800\u00a0m a.s.l. The selected lakes exhibit a large diversity in terms of depth, from 3.5 to 150\u00a0m (on average), surface area (from 0.020 to 6.8\u00a0km\n2), as well \nas trophic state, type, and size of the catchment. For the lakes for which trophic state was available, it ranged from olitgotrophic (nine lakes), meso-eutrophic (one lake), mes-otrophic (17 lakes) to eutrophic (two lakes). Oligotrophic lakes were all situated above 900\u00a0m a.s.l., whereas meso-trophic lakes were distributed from 200 to 1500\u00a0m a.s.l. The meso-eutrophic lake was situated at 500\u00a0m a.s.l. and the eutrophic lakes were between 500 and 1200\u00a0m a.s.l. For 21 lakes, the size of the catchment was not available. It was then estimated by calculation using Google Earth and determin-ing the surrounding of the lakes for the limits of the water -\nshed, considering that the summit of the mountains would be limits of the watershed. Among this set of 40 lakes, five are man-made reservoirs: Speicher Stillup, Schlegeis Speicher, Santa Giustina, Valdora and Zoccolo; three lakes are natural in origin, but used for hydroelectricity production: Achen-see, Cavedine and Molveno; and the rest are natural lakes.\nAncillary measurements\nAt each sampling site, water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were measured in\u00a0situ (about 20\u00a0cm depth) with a portable probe (Hach HQ 40d, LDO101, Loveland, CO, USA). pH was later used to recalculate the initial  CO\n2 \nconcentration of the sample.\nField measurements and\u00a0GHG collection\nMeasurements and sampling were performed at a mini-mum distance of 10\u00a0m from the shore in order to ensure the Dissolved greenhouse gas concentrations in\u00a040 lakes in\u00a0the\u00a0Alpine area  \n1 3 Page 3 of 13 32\nabsence of disturbances induced by the shore (micro waves) \nand the release of GHG at the littoral zone that could bias the sampling (Hofmann et\u00a0al. 2010). As one of our hypotheses relies on the elevation of lakes, attention was paid to sample lakes in the same range of elevation and with similar char -\nacteristics, while we visited lakes in the same geographical region.

Of the total 40 lakes sampled, 14 lakes \nwere sampled once, 17 lakes were sampled twice, 6 lakes were sampled 3 times, and 3 lakes were sampled 4 times. Two lakes were sampled at two different sites: Achensee, due to its large surface, and Santa Giustina for its branched aspect. Among those, eight lakes (Canzolino, Levico, Cal-donazzo, Toblino, Caldaro, Schwarzsee, Pillersee, Reintaler -\nsee) exhibited high values of dissolved methane concentra-tions after the first round of sampling and were thus visited a second time (between 26th and 30th of September 2014). Samples were taken manually with a surface water sampler (Gu\u00e9rin et\u00a0al. 2007) and filled into 60\u00a0mL brown glass vials until overflow of about three times the volume of the bot -\ntle. To stop any biological activity, samples were acidified with copper chloride (Diem et\u00a0al. 2012 ). The vials were then \nclosed, gas tight, with a rubber stopper and an aluminum cap and were kept in the dark, bottom up, to avoid any potential gas leak from the cap, at room temperature until analysis. Analyses were performed within 1\u00a0month.\nCH4 and\u00a0 CO2 analysis\nPrior to the analysis, a headspace was created in the vials by displacing water, about one-third of the total volume of the bottle, with nitrogen (Gu\u00e9rin and Abril 2007). The vial was vigorously shaken until equilibrium, for around 30\u00a0s, to shift dissolved  CH\n4 and  CO2 from the water phase to the gas phase. \nSamples were kept bottom up in the dark until analysis. Analy -\nses of dissolved GHG were done using an Agilent 7890A Gas Chromatographer (GC) equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) for the  CH\n4 compound and a Thermal Con-\nductivity Detector (TCD) for the  CO2 compound. Two injec-\ntions per sample, of 0.5\u00a0mL each, were done. If the difference between two injections, for the same gas, was more than 5%, a third injection was done. The GC was also equipped with an Electron Capture Detector for  N\n2O determination, however \nno significant concentrations of nitrous oxide were detected. A commercial gas standard mixture  (CH\n4 at 8.11\u00a0ppm,  CO2 \nat 501\u00a0ppm and  N2O at 903\u00a0ppb) was used for calibration. \nThe limit of detection is below 1\u00a0ppm (1.4  10\u22123\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121) \nand 5\u00a0ppm (0.22  10\u22123\u00a0\u00b5mol  L\u22121) for  CH4 and  CO2, respec-\ntively. As samples were acidified, all dissolved inorganic car -\nbon was shifted to free  CO2, and the initial amount of  CO2 \n(before acidification) in the headspace was determined using carbonate equilibrium and pH data (collected before and after acidification). Dissolved concentrations of the two GHGs were calculated using their solubility according to Weiss (1974). As lake pH was used to calculate the dissolved  CO\n2 concentration, \npH was not further used as an explanatory variable in order to avoid spurious correlations.\nStatistical analysis\nA first data visualization indicated that the dataset was not normally distributed and had to be log-transformed base 10 (log(X + 1)) for further statistical analysis. For both gases, the \ndifferences between first sampling and second sampling were tested (analysis of covariance of the two groups), but as no significant differences (p > 0.5) were observed, the data from \nall samplings were pooled for further data analyses. A simple Welch t-test was used in order to see if there were any differ -\nences between natural lakes and reservoirs in terms of surface dissolved GHG. To see how variables were correlated to each other, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for all variables of the dataset.\nTo identify potential drivers of  CH\n4 and carbon dioxide dis-\nsolved concentrations, a principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on the dataset using the FactoMineR package. The PCA was followed by a hierarchical clustering analysis on the data, without any a priori grouping (e.g. reservoirs vs natural lakes, by region, etc.).\nFinally, a stepwise linear regression, using the Akaike \nInformation Criterion (AIC) to assess the quality of the model, was used to select the minimum adequate model. All statistical analyses were done using the R software (Team R Core 2012).\nFig. 1  Map of the sampled regions.

On average, surface  CH\n4 dissolved concentrations exceeded ambient concen-\ntrations by a factor of 400 \u00b1 427 (range 0\u20131965), despite \nthe well-oxygenated water at the surface.

CO2 surface dissolved con -\ncentrations exceeded the atmospheric background by a fac-\ntor of 3.27 \u00b1 2.17, ranging from 1.07 to 10.95, with a range \nof concentration, of 2.14\u2013150.41\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121, and average of \n(\u00b1 standard deviation) 36.23 \u00b1 31.15\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121, respectively.Hierarchical clustering\nA hierarchical clustering was applied to characterize the dataset, distinguishing four groups (Fig.\u00a0 2). Cluster 1 was \nonly composed of natural lakes and characterized by the highest values of  CH\n4 and  CO2. It also included the shallow -\nest and smallest lakes. Cluster 4, which was the most differ -\nent compared to the other clusters, was mainly composed \nby reservoirs, except for two natural ones (Caldonazzo and Plansee). The main feature of this group is that the lakes were the deepest and the largest in term of surface area, with the lowest concentrations of dissolved  CH\n4 and  CO2, \ncontrasting with Cluster 1. Cluster 3 was mainly composed of reservoirs and included only one natural lake (Braies). This cluster was characterized by the highest elevations and the lowest surface water temperatures.  CH\n4 and  CO2 surface \nconcentrations were the second lowest among all the clus-ters. Finally, Cluster 2, composed only of natural lakes, had similar average dissolved  CO\n2 concentrations as Cluster 3, \n28.56 and 29.57\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121, respectively, however contrary to \nthe others clusters, none of the independent variables exhib-\nited characteristic features for this group.\nFig. 2  Hierarchical clustering \nfactor map\n S.\u00a0Pighini et al.\n1 3 32 Page 6 of 13\nStatistical analysis\nThe correlation table (Pearson correlation) and the PCA \n(Table\u00a0 2; Fig.\u00a0 3) showed that methane was significantly \npositively correlated with temperature and significantly negatively correlated with surface area, depth and type of lake (Table\u00a0 2). No significant correlations were found for \ndissolved  CO\n2 concentrations. The surface dissolved  CH4 \nand  CO2 concentrations decreased rapidly with lake depth \nuntil around 25\u00a0m depth, at which point concentrations became independent of depth (Figs.\u00a0 4, 5). This is confirmed \nby the PCA analysis (Fig.\u00a0 3), where dissolved GHG arrows \nare opposite to surface area and depth. The same exponential decrease was observed for surface  CH\n4 and  CO2 concentra-\ntions against lake surface area (Figs.\u00a0 4, 5), as a consequence \nof the significant positive correlation existing between lake depth and surface area (Table\u00a0 2). As all reservoirs, except for one (Speicher Stillup), were deeper than 50\u00a0m (significant positive correlation between depth and lake type; Table\u00a0 2), \nthe highest  CH\n4 surface concentrations were found almost \nexclusively in natural lakes (Fig.\u00a0 4). A Welch two-sample \nt-test was performed on the dataset to understand if there was any difference between reservoirs and natural lakes. Results showed that natural and reservoir are different for both  CH\n4 and  CO2 dissolved concentrations (p < 0.001 and \np = 0.0208, respectively). The decrease of surface dissolved \n CO2 concentration with lake depth (Fig.\u00a0 5) was less pro-\nnounced compared to  CH4, and only a few shallow lakes \nhad high concentrations (>  80\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121) of  CO2, explaining \nthe absence of significant correlation for  CO2 as opposed to \n CH4 (Table\u00a0 2). Surface  CO2 concentrations of natural lakes \ndeeper than 20\u00a0m were comparable to those of reservoirs.\nTable 2  Pearson correlation coefficients (p < 0.001, \u201c***\u201d, p < 0.01, \u201c**\u201d, p < 0.05, \u201c*\u201d)\nCH4 \n(\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121)CO2 \n(\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121)Temperature \n(\u00b0C)DO (mg\u00a0L\u22121)Elevation (m) Surface area  (km\n2)Depth (m) Latitude (\u00b0) Type\nCH4 \n(\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121)1.00\nCO2 \n(\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121)0.43*** 1.00\nTemperature \n(\u00b0C)0.39*** 0.14 1.00\nDO (mg  L\u22121) 0.11 \u2212 0.17 0.21 1.00\nElevation (m) \u2212 0.16 \u2212 0.19 \u2212 0.23* \u2212 0.39*** 1.00\nSurface area \n (km2)\u2212 0.38*** \u2212 0.08 0.04 0.21 \u2212 0.15 1.00\nDepth (m) \u2212 0.63*** \u2212 0.16 \u2212 0.18 \u2212 0.05 0.13 0.66*** 1.00\nLatitude (\u00b0) 0.01 0.10 \u2212 0.02 0.00 0.32** 0.06 \u2212 0.06 1.00\nType \u2212 0.43*** \u2212 0.10 \u2212 0.32*** \u2212 0.07 0.10 0.53*** 0.72*** 0.04 1.00\nFig. 3  Principal component \nanalysis.

(Color figure online)\nDissolved greenhouse gas concentrations in\u00a040 lakes in\u00a0the\u00a0Alpine area  \n1 3 Page 7 of 13 32\nExplanatory variables\nIn contrast to our hypothesis that surface dissolved GHG \nconcentrations would decrease with elevation, no clear correlation between both surface dissolved  CH\n4 and  CO2 \nconcentration and elevation could be found, both with the regression analysis (Figs.\u00a0 4, 5) and PCA (Fig.\u00a0 3). Lake \nelevation and temperature were inversely related in the data set (p < 0.05; Table\u00a0 2), lake elevation thus appears \nto represent a poor proxy for lake temperature as a driver for GHG concentrations. Again, in contrast to H2, no latitudinal pattern was observed within the dataset regard-ing  CH\n4 compound (Table\u00a0 2).\nAll reservoirs had measured surface temperatures lower \nthan 20\u00a0\u00b0C and the lowest values of surface dissolved  CH4 \nconcentration (Fig.\u00a0 4). Contrary to  CH4, where highest \ndissolved surface concentrations corresponded to highest surface temperatures, the highest surface  CO\n2 concentra-\ntions corresponded to surface temperatures around 18\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a0 5).\nThe minimum adequate model based on the stepwise \nlinear regression analysis suggests that surface dissolved  CH\n4 concentration can be modelled based on lake depth \nFig. 4  Methane dissolved concentrations as function of a lake depth, \nb surface area, c elevation, and d temperature.

These results are in accord-ance with Tang et\u00a0al. (2014) and Grossart et\u00a0al.

They also showed that an oversaturation of  CH4 was \noverlaying a well-oxygenated mid-water layer. Similar to lake Stechlin, a supersaturation of  CH\n4 was observed in the \nmesotrophic lake Hallwil (Donis et\u00a0al. 2017), and the strati-fied lake Constance (Schulz et\u00a0al. 2001). The  CH\n4 paradox \nregarding  CH4 supersaturation, its origin and its contribution \nto surface concentrations is still under debate. According \nto Wang et\u00a0al. (2017), this  CH4 oversaturation layer would \nbe produced by phototrophs, together with oxygen tolerant methanogens, leading to a pelagic methane-enriched zone. Whereas, Fern\u00e0ndez et\u00a0al. ( 2016 ) stated that  CH\n4 surface \nconcentrations would mainly come from shallow zones, where water is rich in methane. In order to verify if Alpine lakes also exhibit this oversaturated layer of  CH\n4 overlaying \na well-oxygenated water layer,  CH4 samples along the water \ncolumn would be needed. In addition, ebullition, methane-\nrich air bubbles rising from the lake bottom, may be con-tributing to the observed super-saturation of surface waters (McGinnis et\u00a0al. 2006; Tang et\u00a0al. 2014; Deshmukh et\u00a0al. 2014).\nLake surface temperature is closely related to air tempera-\nture (Livingstone and Lotter 1998 ; Livingstone and Dokulil \n2001 ). As  CH\n4 production is temperature dependent (Zeikus \nand Winfrey 1976; Dunfield et\u00a0al. 1993; Duc et\u00a0al. 2010), we \nhypothesized (H2) a positive relationship between surface dissolved  CH\n4 concentrations and lake temperature (r = 0.39, \np < 0.001). Commonly, elevation is seen as a proxy for tem-\nperature due to the decrease of air temperature with eleva-tion. Accordingly, we further expected a decrease of dis -\nsolved  CH\n4 concentration with increasing elevation. Indeed, \nwe observed a negative correlation between lake temperature and elevation and a significant positive relationship between lake temperature and dissolved methane concentrations, however, no significant relationship between lake elevation and dissolved methane concentrations was found (Table\u00a0 2). \nThis suggests that lake elevation is a poor proxy for captur -\ning the relationship between lake temperature and dissolved  CH\n4 concentrations, possibly because other factors, e.g. lake \ndepth and/or surface area, are confounding the relationship with elevation. Similarly, no relationship was observed between  CH\n4 concentration and latitude, which suggests \nthat the latitudinal gradient between the sampled lakes was either too small to result in a measurable trend in terms of surface dissolved  CH\n4 and/or confounded by other factors.\nAbril et\u00a0al. (2007) showed that turbidity was negatively \ncorrelated to  CH4 concentrations in river environments, \nwhereas Oswald et\u00a0al. (2015) showed that light was promot-\ning the  CH4 oxidation by  CH4 oxidizing bacteria which was \nalso confirmed by Dumestre et\u00a0al. (1999), for both natural and artificial lakes. While turbidity was not measured in the present study, some of the highest methane concentrations were measured in lakes that were characterised by dark brownish colours (e.g. M\u00f6serer See, Levico, Caldaro), cor -\nresponding with the above-mentioned studies.\nThe minimum adequate model indicated that  CH\n4 could \nbe predicted through a positive relationship with water sur -\nface temperature and a negative relationship with depth, which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the relationship between  CH\n4 and temperature (Sch\u00fctz et\u00a0al. \n1989; Rasilo et\u00a0al. 2014).\nThe near-surface dissolved  CH4 concentration decreased \nwith depth of the lakes (Fig.\u00a0 4). In deep lakes, the oxida-\ntion of  CH4 into  CO2 prevails during the diffusion of  CH4 \nmolecules upwards through the water column (Bastviken \net\u00a0al. 2004). The deeper a lake is, the less dissolved  CH4 is \nmeasured at the surface. This is consistent with results of this dataset, where the lowest dissolved  CH\n4 concentrations \nwere measured for the deepest lakes. Similar results were also found for boreal lakes, where  CH\n4 was negatively corre-\nlated with lake depth and surface  CH4 concentrations meas-\nured were the highest in shallow lakes (Juutinen et\u00a0al. 2009). Juutinen et\u00a0al. (2009) and Borges et\u00a0al. (2011) also found a negative correlation with lake surface area, as observed for this dataset (Table\u00a0 2). The low concentrations measured at \nthe surface can also be explained by the stratification created in the water column of deep lakes, which supports the accu-mulation and isolation of GHG at the bottom of the lakes (Salmaso and Mosello 2010). In addition, surface sediments may warm faster in shallow lakes, resulting in a larger meth-ane production, which contributes to higher concentrations in shallow lakes (Thebrath et\u00a0al. 1993).\nReservoirs  CH\n4 concentrations were comparable with the \nresults that Diem et\u00a0al. (2012) found for Swiss hydropower reservoirs within a similar range of elevation. Similarly to this study, Diem et\u00a0al. (2012) measured surface  CH\n4 con-\ncentrations just at or above supersaturation. The results of the present study for the reservoirs are also within the same order of magnitude found by Duchemin et\u00a0al. ( 1995) for \ntwo hydroelectric reservoirs situated in the Canadian boreal region. This, compared to natural lakes, is typically much shorter residence time of surface waters, which affects carbon input, processing, and output (Adrian et\u00a0al. 2009 ; \nVenkiteswaran et\u00a0al. 2013), may further contribute to the \nobserved lower dissolved  CH\n4 concentrations in reservoirs, \nand explain the difference in term of dissolved  CH4 (and \n CO2) between natural lakes and reservoirs.\nThe significant correlation between lake depth and sur -\nface area (Table\u00a0 2) found for Alpine water bodies is also \nsupported by Kankaala et\u00a0al. (2013) and Juutinen et\u00a0al. (2009) for boreal water bodies, showing that lake depth and \nsurface area were positively correlated. They also reported a negative correlation between  CH\n4 surface concentration \nand lake surface area. As observed for boreal regions (e.g.  S.\u00a0Pighini et al.\n1 3 32 Page 10 of 13\nBastviken et\u00a0al. 2004 ), lakes situated in the Alpine area were \nalso characterized by a negative correlation between  CH4 \nsurface concentration and lake surface area.\nCarbon dioxide concentration\nThe range of dissolved  CO2 concentration for both natural \nlakes and reservoirs was in the same order of magnitude as \nthe one found for Swiss reservoirs, which were in the same range of elevations (Diem et\u00a0al. 2012), and for other lakes (Casper et\u00a0al. 2000; Sobek et\u00a0al. 2003; Lazzarino et\u00a0al. 2009; Panneer Selvam et\u00a0al. 2014).\nAs observed for  CH\n4, all lakes were supersaturated in \nsurface dissolved  CO2 (average 36\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121) compared to \nthe  CO2 atmospheric concentration (13.74\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0L\u22121). These \nresults are consistent and agree with the findings of Cole et\u00a0al. ( 1994 ), who analyzed a worldwide set of lakes in which \n87% of them were supersaturated, on average by a factor of three compared to the atmospheric concentration. This is also consistent with Sobek et\u00a0al. (2005), who showed that most of the world\u2019s lakes were supersaturated in  CO\n2, with-\nout following a latitudinal pattern, and that temperature was not a good predictor for  CO\n2 partial pressure.\nThe minimum adequate linear model for  CO2 included a \nnegative relationship with elevation and dissolved oxygen. \nThe low value of the adjusted  r2 and the relatively high value \nof the RMSE and the fact that no single variable was sig-nificantly correlated with  CO\n2 (Table\u00a0 2), suggest that other \nexplanatory variables are required to establish a robust linear model for  CO\n2, like dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll \na, or ion contents. As shown by Xenopoulos et\u00a0al. ( 2003 ), \nthe concentration of dissolved organic carbon decreases with elevation, the inclusion of elevation in the minimum adequate model may thus, partially and indirectly, account for differences in dissolved organic carbon contents between lakes. According to Kosten et\u00a0al. (2010),  CO\n2 partial pres-\nsure  (pCO2) could be partially explained by water tempera-\nture, together with other variables such as chlorophyll a , \nhumic substances inflow or evaporation.  CO2 concentration \nis then driven by a group of variables, which could explain why temperature, by itself, did not explain  CO\n2 variability \nfor this dataset.\nAs for dissolved  CH4, similar trends, albeit not signifi-\ncant, were observed for dissolved  CO2 as a function of lake \ndepth and elevation: higher concentrations of dissolved  CO\n2 were found for shallow natural lakes, compared to \nreservoirs which all, except two of them, were deeper than 100\u00a0m. The range of  CO\n2 concentrations for the reservoirs \nin this dataset was lower than the range found by Diem et\u00a0al. (2012), and lower than boreal reservoirs (Duchemin et\u00a0al. \n1995) and tropical reservoirs (Abril et\u00a0al. 2006). Compared to the reservoirs studied by Duchemin et\u00a0al. (1995) and Abril et\u00a0al. (2006), reservoirs for this study were mainly at high elevation, explaining the low values of  CO\n2 measured. \nHowever, for the same range of elevation in the study of Diem et\u00a0al. (2012) and this one, the results found for Swiss hydropower reservoirs were up to five times higher than our dataset. No clear explanation could be found to explain the difference between the two sets of reservoirs, however, this could be due to the age of the reservoirs (Abril et\u00a0al. 2005). Another factor explaining the near-surface concentration differences between lakes is the presence of stratification, which typically goes along with an accumulation of  CO\n2 \n(and  CH4) in bottom waters. As shown by Kortelainen et\u00a0al. \n(2006), there is a positive relationship between  CO2 con-\ncentrations in surface waters and in water layers above the \nsediment that can lead to supersaturation. Future studies should aim at supplementing near-surface water concentra-tions with samples from bottom waters and/or determine oxygen profiles.\nKankaala et\u00a0al. (2013), found a negative correlation \nbetween the surface  CO\n2 concentration and surface area of \nboreal lakes. Such a correlation was not found for our data-set (Table\u00a0 2), presumably because, as shown by the linear \nmodel, surface dissolved  CO\n2 in the alpine area is explained \nby a combination of variables.\nCluster anaysis\nWhen testing correlations between  CO2 and  CH4 concentra-\ntions for each cluster, it appeared that none was present for Cluster 4 (data not shown here). This cluster was composed by the largest and the deepest lakes\u2014mostly reservoirs\u2014with supposed small allochthonous input.  CO\n2 can be pro-\nduced at the surface of the water by respiration, but can also originate from the oxidation of  CH\n4, produced in the \nanoxic layer by methanogenesis, while reaching the epilim-nion of the lake. These differences could explain the absence of a correlation in Cluster 4. Distinguishing natural lakes from reservoirs, as implied in H1, was not a relevant crite-rion, since reservoirs were found in two of the four clusters (Fig.\u00a0 2).\nOn the other hand, Cluster 1, was characterized by the \nhighest values for dissolved  CH\n4 and  CO2 and the highest \nsurface water temperature, corroborating the relationship between  CH\n4 and water temperature (Yvon-Durocher et\u00a0al. \n2014 ) and our hypothesis (H1). Lakes in this cluster were \nalso the smallest and the shallowest, and dissolved  CH4 and \n CO2 were correlated to each other  (r2 = 0.60) suggesting that \nboth compounds would have the same origin, and that part of  CO\n2 would come from the oxidation of  CH4, and where \ntemperature would enhance GHG production.\nThe results of the cluster analysis can be used to guide \nsite selection of future studies. In particular for experimen-tal approaches that are more time consuming compared to the sampling in this study and thus not practical at multiple Dissolved greenhouse gas concentrations in\u00a040 lakes in\u00a0the\u00a0Alpine area  \n1 3 Page 11 of 13 32\nlakes (e.g. direct lake-atmosphere flux measurements using \nthe eddy covariance method; Eugster et\u00a0al. 2011), the cluster analysis may help to select the most appropriate study site with respect to the study objectives and experimental limita -\ntions (e.g. flux detection limit).\nConclusions\nThe main result of this study is that the near-surface waters of all investigated lakes, except one, were super-saturated in both surface dissolved  CH\n4 and  CO2 suggesting that \nthese lakes tend to act as sources of  CH4 and  CO2 to the \natmosphere. The water-atmosphere exchange of trace gases depends, in addition to the gradient between dissolved near-surface water and ambient air concentrations, on the transfer velocity across the water\u2013air interface (Wanninkhof 2014). Previous studies that quantified both dissolved concentra-tions and fluxes of  CH\n4 and  CO2 reported super-saturation \nratios similar to this study that went along with significant  CH\n4 and  CO2 emissions (Sobek et\u00a0al. 2003; Bastviken et\u00a0al. \n2008; Diem et\u00a0al. 2012; Panneer Selvam et\u00a0al. 2014; Natchi-muthu et\u00a0al. 2014). Even though this study did not directly quantify the lake-atmosphere exchange or the transfer veloc-ity across the water\u2013air interface, our dissolved near-surface water concentrations thus suggest that lakes in the Alpine region would act as carbon sources to the atmosphere.\nThe variability of near-surface water dissolved  CH\n4 con-\ncentrations was best explained by water temperature, higher temperatures increasing the production of  CH\n4, and lake \ndepth, methane oxidation reducing near-surface concen-\ntrations in deeper lakes. Given that the Alps have warmed twice as fast compared to the global average during the past 100\u00a0years (Auer et\u00a0al. 2007), the significant relationship \nbetween near-surface water dissolved  CH\n4 concentrations \nand water temperature warrants further studies on the mag-nitude of the resulting atmospheric feedback. Near-surface water dissolved  CO\n2 concentrations were best predicted by \ndissolved oxygen and elevation, however the overall fraction of explained variance was very low, suggesting that critical explanatory factors were missing for  CO\n2.\nFurther studies are encouraged that seek to clarify the \ncauses and drivers underlying the observed scatter in the \ndata, in particular for  CO2, and additionally attempt to con-\nfirm the implied relationship between dissolved gas concen-trations and the corresponding water-atmosphere exchange.\nAcknowledgements Open access funding provided by University of \nInnsbruck and Medical University of Innsbruck.

The intensification of \nanthropogenic pressures on hydrosystems requires studies of human-impacted rivers to identify and quantify the main drivers of carbon evasion. In 2016 and 2017, four field campaigns were conducted \nin the Seine River network characterized by an intensively cropped and highly populated basin. We \nmeasured partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pCO\n2) in streams or rivers draining land under different \nuses at different seasons. We also computed pCO2 from an existing data set (pH, water temperature and \ntotal alkalinity) going back until 1970. Here we report factors controlling pCO2 that operate at different \ntime and space scales. In our study, the Seine River was shown to be supersaturated in CO2 with respect \nto the atmospheric equilibrium, as well as a source of CO2. Our results suggest an increase in pCO2 from \nwinter to summer in small streams draining forests (from 1670 to 2480 ppm), croplands (from 1010 to 1550 ppm), and at the outlet of the basin (from 2490 to 3630 ppm). The main driver of pCO\n2 was shown \nto be dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (R2 = 0.56, n = 119, p < 0.05) that are modulated \nby hydro-climatic conditions and groundwater discharges. DOC sources were linked to land use and soil, mainly leaching into small upstream streams, but also to organic pollution, mainly found downstream \nin larger rivers. Our long-term analysis of the main stream suggests that pCO\n2 closely mirrors the \npattern of urban water pollution over time. These results suggest that factors controlling pCO2 operate \ndifferently upstream and downstream depending on the physical characteristics of the river basin and \non the intensity and location of the main anthropogenic pressures. The influence of these controlling \nfactors may also differ over time, according to the seasons, and mirror long term changes in these \nanthropogenic pressures.\nGlobally, streams and rivers are estimated to contribute significantly to carbon budgets, with two recent studies \nestimating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the order of .\u2212.+.065017020 PgC yr\u22121 and 1.80 \u00b1 0.25 PgC yr\u22121 1,2. This \nwide range underlines continuing uncertainty, and regional studies are thus needed to provide a better descrip-tion of the processes driving these carbon fluxes.\nExcessive or deficient CO\n2 concentration in water with respect to atmospheric equilibrium determines \nwhether inland waters are a CO2 source or sink. In the majority of river drainage networks, the ratio of primary \nproduction to respiration is less than 1, contributing to carbon evasion from inland waters to the atmosphere3\u20135. \nCO2 supersaturation in waters with respect to the CO2 atmospheric equilibrium can result from the bacterial \nmineralization of biodegradable organic material exported from soils and autochthonous production as well as inorganic carbon imports from soils (weathering of the bedrock, acidification of buffered waters, etc.)\n6. In rivers \nwith extensive wetlands (flooded forests and floating macrophytes), lateral DOC enhancing mineralization in the river channel\u2019s and CO\n2 transports are particularly important7\u201310. In addition, CO2 in rivers can be transferred \nfrom groundwaters11.\nUnder the temperate European climate, partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) values in rivers display significant \nvariability related to land use, lithology and hydrological conditions. For example, in France, pCO2 levels of \n1Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut Pierre Simon Laplace, UMR, 7619 \nMETIS, Paris, France. 2Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, Unit\u00e9 d\u2019Oc\u00e9anographie Chimique, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium.

A recent study of the Meuse \nRiver14 revealed marked variations in pCO2 (34 to 10,033 ppm) the higher values being associated with water -\nsheds dominated by agriculture and lower values with forested watersheds. CO2 undersaturation with respect to \nthe atmospheric equilibrium has been demonstrated in the upstream part of the Danube River basin related to \nphotosynthetic uptake in summer15.\nIn the Seine River basin, previous carbon investigations focused on organic carbon16, methane emissions from \nsoils, livestock and the river network17 or on benthic respiration18 and ecological status based on the production/\nrespiration ratio4. These studies did not specifically address CO2 concentrations. Our objective here was to quan-\ntify pCO2 in the Seine River, using both recent in situ  measurements and calculations based on long time series \nof existing data, in order to evaluate the distribution of pCO2 and CO2 evasion in the drainage network, and to \nidentify the major factors controlling pCO2.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy site. The Seine River watershed, located in northern France, covers an area of 76,750 km2 with a \nmedian slope of 2.2\u00b0 and 89.5% of its area is less than 300 m A.S.L. It has a pluvio-oceanic regime and its annual \nwater flow in the period 2013\u20132016 averaged 550 m3 s\u22121 at the river outlet at Poses (Fig.\u00a0 1). The Poses monitoring \nstation, located at a navigation dam, is the most downstream station not subject to the dynamic influence of the tidal estuary. Low water flows (< 300 m\n3 s\u22121) are generally observed from March to November, while high flows \n(>800 m3 s\u22121) occur in winter, from December to February (data provided by the HYDRO database, http://www.\nhydro.eaufrance.fr , 2018).\nThree major diverted reservoirs (Fig.\u00a0 1a) located in the upstream part of the basin (the Marne reservoir, the \nAube reservoir and the Seine reservoir) were built to reduce high water events in winter, and to sustain the flow in late summer. They have a combined storage capacity of 800 10\n6 m3 and a surface area of 65 km\u00b2 19.\nThe basin is densely populated (~230 inhabitants km\u22122) mostly concentrated in the Paris conurbation (12.4 \nmillion inhabitants in 2015) in the central part of the basin. The largest wastewater treatment plant in Europe: Seine Aval, (French acronym SAV) WWTP with a dry weather capacity of 1,500,000 m\n3 d\u22121) is located 50 km down-\nstream of the center of Paris (Fig.\u00a0 1b). The corresponding effluents account for more than 30% of the organic carbon \nload of all the WWTPs in the basin20. Major upgrading of wastewater treatments of the SAV followed the Urban \nWastewater Treatment Directive (1991, 91/271/CEE) among which the addition of flocculation (2000\u20132003), nitri-fication (2007) and denitrification (30% in 2007 and 70% in 2012)\n21. The Seine counts about 1700 smaller capacity \nFigure 1. Maps of the Seine river basin created using QGIS software60.

The basin comprises 56.8% arable land (mainly under intensive \nagriculture), 25.8% forests, 9.7% grasslands and 7.0% urban areas (CLC database, IFEN 2012, Fig.\u00a0 1c). Wetlands \nhave been estimated at between 10.9% and 15.6% of the surface area of the basin22. The Strahler stream order23 \nof the main stream of the basin is 6th order for the Marne River and 7th order for the Seine River downstream of \nParis (Fig.\u00a0 1a). The sedimentary basin of the Seine River is characterized by geological formations with low slope \ngradients resulting in concentric lithology dominated by carbonate and limestone in the central part of the basin, a \nwide band of Cretaceous chalk and a narrow band of clay followed by Jurassic limestone at the periphery (Fig.\u00a0 1d).\nSampling strategy, physical-chemical analysis and direct measurements of pCO2.  We sampled \n30 sites in streams chosen because they mainly drain grasslands, forests and wetlands, croplands, and along the main streams of the Marne River (including in its reservoir) and of the lower Seine (Fig.\u00a0 1a, exact locations in \nSupplementary Material 1). Sampling campaigns were carried out in four contrasting hydro-climatological peri-ods. Water discharges were measured at the outlet of the basin (Poses) and temperatures were measured at each \nsampling site in winter from February 22 to March 10, 2016, (1030 m\n3 s\u22121, 6.9 \u00b0C on average), in summer/autumn \nfrom September 7 to 14, 2016, (270 m3 s\u22121, 18.8 \u00b0C), spring from March 14 to 23, 2017, (580 m3 s\u22121, 9.9 \u00b0C) as \nwell as during a spring flood event that was exceptional in its timing, from May 23 to June 2, 2016, (1500 m3 s\u22121, \n13.0 \u00b0C, at sampling time with a maximum discharge reaching 2000 m3 s\u22121 at the river outlet, at Poses). The field \ncampaigns were assumed to be key seasonal and hydrological periods and were conducted in areas representing \nthe main types of land use in the Seine River basin.\nDirect pCO2 measurements were based on the syringe headspace technique12,24 combined with non-dispersive \ninfrared gas analysis (IRGA) (Li-cor \u00ae models 820 or 840; accuracy <3% of reading). Calibration was performed \nusing CO2 concentration of 799 ppm and CO2-free dinitrogen. Four syringes coupled with three-way valves were \nfilled directly in the stream or river, each replicate containing 30 mL of river water and 30 mL of atmospheric air. \nClosed syringes were continuously shaken for 10  min to equilibrate CO2 concentrations of gas and water. The \nequilibrated gas was injected into the IRGA and water temperature inside the syringe was measured. The first injection served as a purge and the other three were used for pCO\n2 measurements. The initial pCO2 in water \nwas computed based on the pCO2 measured in the equilibrated air of the syringe and in the atmospheric air, and \nHenry\u2019s law accounting for the water temperature in the syringe and in situ .\nSimultaneously, 2 L water chemistry high-density polyethylene sampling bottles were used to collect samples \nfrom bridges over the main stream, and along the banks of smaller streams. Water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and conductivity were measured in the field using a multi-parameter probe (YSI\u00ae 6600 V2, accuracy \u00b1 0.2 \nunits). Calibrations of the probe were completed with pH 7 and pH 4 buffers for pH (NBS Scale), potassium \nFigure 2.

In the lab-\noratory, water subsamples were filtered on combusted filters for 4 h at 500 \u00b0C: GF/F 0.7 \u00b5m, 25 mm) to analyze \nparticulate inorganic and organic carbon (PIC and POC, respectively). Filtrates enabled measurement of dis-\nsolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC and DOC) concentrations and total alkalinity (TA). One milliliter of sulfuric acid (3  M) was added to the DOC samples to stop biological reactions. Dissolved inorganic and organic \ncarbon were analyzed with a TOC analyzer (Aurora 1030). Nongaseous DIC analyses required acidification of the filtrated sample by adding sodium persulfate reagents (100  g L\n\u22121) to dissociate the carbonates in the CO2 that were \ndetected by an IRGA. The inorganic free sample was used for DOC measurements. DOC was measured by wet oxidation by adding 10% phosphoric acid oxide followed by high temperature (680 \u00b0C) catalytic combustion, and \nthen detected using an NDIR technique. TA (\u00b5 mol kg\n\u22121) was analyzed using an automatic titrator (TitroLine \u00ae \n5000) on three 20 mL replicates of filtered water (GF/F: 0.7 \u03bcm), with hydrochloric acid (0.1 M).\nValues of total suspended solids (TSS) were determined as the weight of material retained on a Whatman \nGF/F membrane per volume unit after drying the filter for 2 h at 120 \u00b0C. Chlorophyll a  concentrations (Chl. a) \nwere determined according to Lorenzen25.\nAquifer waters were also sampled during the same periods. Groundwater was pumped from the piezometers \nusing a peristaltic pump. Before the samples were collected, the piezometers were emptied by flushing to remove the standing water (5\u201310 L in each piezometer)\n26. The same variables were measured or analyzed, except Chl. a.\npCO2 calculations from existing data.  pCO2 were computed with the CO2SYS software27 using the water \ntemperature and two of the three following measurements: pH, TA and DIC. In contrast to DIC, TA is often measured by the French water authorities Agence de l\u2019Eau Seine Normandie (French acronym AESN, http://www.eau-seine-normandie.fr/, 2018), and thus were preferred to compute pCO\n2 in combination with pH and water \ntemperatures. The carbonate dissociation constants (K1 and K2) applied were from Millero28 with zero salinity.\nDuring our field campaigns (winter 2016, spring 2017, spring flood 2016, summer/autumn 2016, see previous \nsection ), we systematically combined direct measurements of pCO2 with measurements of water temperature, pH \nand TA (130 samples). We found a positive relationship between the pCO2 values directly measured during our \nfield campaigns and those calculated using water temperatures, pH and TA (Fig.\u00a0 2). This relationship was then \nused to correct possible bias12 of pCO2 values calculated with CO2SYS program.\nWe also used the database (42,108 data with simultaneous water temperatures, pH and TA measured between \n1971 and 2015) provided by the French water authorities (AESN) to compute and analyze the pCO2 dynamics in \nthe Seine basin in space and over time since the 1970s. These pCO2 data series were corrected by the relationship \npreviously established and then averaged by months and years at each monitoring station. Within this timeframe (1970\u20132015), two periods of interest (ii) 1989\u20131991 (92 monitoring stations) and (ii) 2013\u20132015 (234 monitor -\ning stations) were defined as representative of the changes that occurred recently in the Seine river basin. The former period (1989\u20131991) represents the period of highest organic pollution from WWTPs, only treated by \nactivated sludge. The most recent period (2013\u20132015) illustrates the state after a full implementation of the Urban \nWastewater Treatment Directive (1991, 91/271/CEE), including the reduction of point sources of organic carbon (industrial and domestic) discharge into the river, as well as phosphorus and nitrogen\n20,21,29. In addition, we \nassessed the spatial variability of pCO2 along the main stream of the Seine River, comparing the concentrations of \nthe most important effluents up- and downstream (Paris and Poses stations, Fig.\u00a0 1) of the SAV WWTP . We also \ncomputed pCO2 at a constant temperature of 10  \u00b0C (pCO2@10 \u00b0C) downstream of the SAV WWTP to show the \nimpact of solubility on pCO2 (see results section: \u201cLong-term pCO2 variability (1970\u20132015)\u201d).\nDetermination of gas transfer velocities. Raymond et al.30 pointed out that gas transfer velocity equa-\ntions including slope and water velocity enable easy measurements and recommended the use of these equations at large spatial scales. We selected the equation requiring only the slope and the water velocity and that had the highest squared-R in the Raymond et al .\n30 study (Equation 5 in Table 2 in Raymond et al. (2012)) as we wanted \nto compare the variability of CO2 evasion in the basin in space and over time.

Water velocities \nwere estimated from discharge records available at the scale of the whole drainage network for the period 2012\u2013\n2014. Water temperatures were averaged by season of interest based on our field campaigns (winter, spring and summer/autumn). The k -values were calculated by stream order and then aggregated by small streams (Strahler \norders (SOs) 1\u20134) and along the main stream (SOs 5\u20137).

All statistical tests were performed using R software34.\nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare measured pCO2 in the four periods, and Kruskal-Wallis \ntests were used to compare measured pCO2 averages for different land uses during each period.

Linear regressions were then performed between pCO2 and water quality variables.\nResults\nMeasured versus calculated pCO2.

Average water temperatures ranged between 6.9  \u00b0C and 18  \u00b0C which \ncorresponds to the expected seasonal range for the Seine basin (Table\u00a0 1). pH values were generally neutral to \nbasic, with median values of pH and TA in all streams and rivers ranging respectively from 7.75 to 8.25 and from \n3150 \u00b5mole l\u22121 to 4350 \u00b5 mole l\u22121 (see Table\u00a0 1). Only two acidic pH values measured during the winter in streams \ndraining forests (data not shown). The high total alkalinity measured in all the streams and rivers (Table\u00a0 1) indi-\ncated that waters were carbonate-buffered due to the lithology of the basin, which is dominated by carbonate rocks (Fig.\u00a0 1d)\n35. Indeed, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations were high (min.: 19.3 mgC l\u22121, Table\u00a0 1) \nas was conductivity (median of all campaigns: 0.554 mS cm\u22122), suggesting that bicarbonate ions contributed most \nto total alkalinity. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations averaged 52.55 mgC l\u22121 (median: 54.04 mgC \nl\u22121). Dissolved organic (DOC) concentrations were one order of magnitude lower than those of DIC, the highest \nbeing observed in streams draining wetlands (median: 17.25 mgC l\u22121) while streams draining croplands had the \nlowest concentrations (median: 2.62 mgC l\u22121). Total suspended solids (TSS) were highest (median 20.77 mg l\u22121) in \ngrasslands during the spring flood 2016 (with a median chlorophyll a  concentration of 27.1 \u00b5g l\u22121). Wetlands were \nmostly undersaturated in oxygen (median: 5.7 mgO2 l\u22121 and min. water temperature: 6.1 \u00b0C) while the rest of the \ndata set showed oxygenated waters (median: 9.2 mgO2 l\u22121; min. \u2013 max.: 6.0\u201315.7 mgO2 l\u22121).\nVariability in pCO2. Spatial and seasonal variability of pCO2. All samples were supersaturated in CO2 \nwith respect to the atmosphere, regardless of river characteristics (small stream or main stream), the associ-ated dominant land use and the season (Fig.\u00a0 3a). pCO\n2 increased significantly i.e., by an average of 49% and www.nature.com/scientificreports/6\nSCIEnTIFIC  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:13961  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32332-262% from winter to summer/autumn, in streams draining forests and croplands ( p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank \ntest, Fig.\u00a0 3a). Values in grasslands did not typically follow this pattern (p  > 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, \nFig.\u00a0 3a), and pCO2 remained rather stable at 2,900 ppm, whereas pCO2 was the highest in wetlands (p  < 0.05, \nKruskal-Wallis test), especially in spring and summer/autumn (>4500 ppm).\nFor each of the four seasons monitored, pCO2 average decreases ranked as follows: wetlands > grass -\nlands  > forests >  croplands (p  < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis tests, Fig.\u00a0 3a). At the outlet of the Seine River, the main \nstream drains composite land uses where pCO2 averages were found to be equivalent to those measured in small \nstreams draining grasslands (Fig.\u00a0 3b).\nIn the lower Seine River, which is highly impacted by urbanization and associated treated WWTP effluents, \na 69% increase in pCO2 was observed from winter (December to February), to spring (March to June) to sum-\nmer/autumn (June to November) with limited dilution by the discharge (mean discharge in winter: 1030 m3 s\u22121; \nspring: 580 m3 s\u22121; summer/autumn: 270 m3 s\u22121) (Fig.\u00a0 3b, Table\u00a0 1).\nHowever, during the late spring flood (1500 m3 s\u22121 at Poses, the Seine river outlet), pCO2 averages increased \nin all the land uses (3100, 3200, 5900, 8400 ppm for croplands, forests, grasslands and wetlands, respectively) \n(Fig.\u00a0 3a).\nIn the groundwater, pCO2 averaged 27,000 ppm at a yearly scale, but reached up to 65,000 ppm (summer/\nautumn 2016), i.e., a factor of 5 to 10 compared to surface waters.\nAccording to the k600 equation selected (see Materials and Methods, equations\u00a0 1\u20133), gas transfer velocity \n(k-values) was estimated from the slopes. k-value  was higher for small streams (0.006 m m\u22121) than larger rivers \n(0.0004  m m\u22121) (Fig.\u00a04a ). Seasonal variations in water temperature increased from winter to summer/autumn \n(Fig.\u00a0 4b), and velocities decreased from winter to summer/autumn (Fig.\u00a0 4c). The resulting k-values ranged from \n0.08 to 0.24 m h\u22121 with a decrease from small streams (k  annual average = 0.19 m h\u22121) to larger rivers (k  annual \naverage = 0.09 m h\u22121) (Fig.\u00a0 4d).\nUsing equation (2 ), the higher slopes found in small streams led to higher k-values (Fig.\u00a0 4a and d). \nAdditionally, in the small streams in the Seine River basin, the water velocity effect prevails over the seasonal k dynamics, while control by water temperature is greater in higher stream orders (Fig.\u00a0 4b\u2013d ). During the spring \nflood event, the increase in the water discharge (and velocity) led to a greater increase in k in small streams than \nin larger rivers, respectively + 26% (spring flood: 0.24 m h\n\u22121) and + 11% (spring flood: 0.10 m h\u22121) compared to \naverage spring k-values (small streams: 0.19 m h\u22121, larger rivers: 0.09 m h\u22121).\nCO2 fluxes at the water-atmosphere interface (Fig.\u00a0 4e) were estimated using the pCO2 measurements we made \nduring our field campaigns (Fig.\u00a0 3), CO2 saturation values that depend on water temperatures (see Table\u00a0 1), \natmospheric pCO2, and k -values estimations (Fig.\u00a0 4d). The same seasonal pattern was observed for pCO2 and \nCO2 fluxes.\nLong-term pCO2 variability (1970\u20132015). Long-term analysis of French water authority (AESN) data-\nbases showed supersaturation of CO2 of the Seine River dating back to 1970 (98.5% data suggested supersatura-\ntion with respect to atmospheric equilibrium \u2013 pCO2 median = 3030 ppm; mean = 4765 ppm). From that period \non, the Seine River has been a source of CO2 to the atmosphere even when frequent phytoplankton blooms \noccurred before wastewater treatment was improved. However, focusing on the bloom events (Chl. a >50 \u00b5g l\u22121, \nFig.\u00a0 5), we observed the opposite pattern between Chl. a and pCO2 dynamics, with depletion of pCO2 concomi-\ntantly with peaks of phytoplankton. This consumption of CO2 was not sufficient to cause undersaturation of CO2 \nin the river (Fig.\u00a0 5).\nWhen we compared the two contrasted periods with respect to water sanitation and associated organic carbon \nreleases, we found a similar range of temperature and discharge values and a seasonal pattern typical of temperate \noceanic hydro-climatology regimes, i.e., high temperatures and low water in summer/autumn. The first of these \ntwo periods was however slightly drier than the second (on average 400 m3 s\u22121 vs. 545 m3 s\u22121, respectively) with \nFigure 3. Boxplots of pCO2 assembled as function of the land uses and seasons investigated.

We observed that pCO2 computed \nat both 10 \u00b0C and at water temperature were similar during winter but values at 10 \u00b0C were slightly lower than at \nwater temperature during summer (Fig.\u00a0 6). However, general trends of pCO2 did not change.\nIn contrast, pCO2 was reduced by a factor of 2.7 between the two periods (average 8250 ppm for the period \n1989\u20131991 versus 3020 ppm for the period 2013\u20132015). These weak hydro-climatologic changes cannot explain \nthe marked decrease in pCO2 at the river outlet between the two periods. We found no relationship between \npCO2 and discharge at this time scale, despite a clear antiparallel trend for these two variables (Fig.\u00a0 6).\nTo further explore the recent decrease in pCO2, we assessed spatial variations in pCO2 at the scale of the whole \nSeine drainage network (Fig.\u00a0 7). Although fewer measurements were available in the earlier period (1989\u20131991), \nthe decrease in pCO2 between the two periods was obvious along the lower reach of the main stream of the \nSeine River, downstream of the Paris conurbation. In the recent period, the pCO2 of both the upstream parts \nof the drainage network and the main stream of the Seine River appear to be equally supersaturated (p > 0.05, \nKruskal-Wallis tests, Fig.\u00a0 7).\nSince the 1970s, upstream of the discharge of treated effluent from the SAV WWTP , the long-term trend of \npCO2 values in Paris has varied around 5000 ppm (Fig.\u00a0 8a). A few kilometers downstream, at the outlet of the \nSeine River at Poses (strongly influenced by Parisian wastewater discharges) pCO2 progressively increased to \nFigure 4.

This decrease in pCO2 was concomitant with changes in the fluxes of biodegradable total organic car -\nbon (BTOC) discharged by the WWTPs of the Parisian conurbation managed and operated by the Greater Paris sanitation authority (French acronym SIAAP) after treatment (Fig.\u00a0 8a). From the 1990s to 2015, the BTOC load \ndecreased by 80% (from 13.8 to 2.8 kt BTOC yr\n\u22121) following treatment improvements on the SAV WWTP site, \nthe construction of a new WWTP in 1991 and of three new WWTPs between 2005 and 2008, conjointly with improvement in treatment at existing plants. A positive linear relationship (R\n2 = 0.52, n =  29, p <  0.05) was found \nbetween annual pCO2 at the outlet of the Seine River (Poses) and BTOC fluxes from\u00a0the SIAAP WWTPs (Fig.\u00a0 8b).\npCO2 environmental controls. We found a positive linear relationship between pCO2 and DOC (R2 = 0.56, \nn = 119) (Fig.\u00a0 9a). DOC measured in grasslands (DOC average: 10.3 mg L\u22121; SD: 5.8 mg L\u22121) and wetlands (DOC \naverage: 21.0  mg L\u22121; SD: 14.6  mg L\u22121) showed wider and higher ranges of concentration compared to arable lands \n(DOC average: 3.8 mg L\u22121; SD: 2.7 mg L\u22121) (Fig.\u00a0 9a). Generally, the ranges of DOC and pCO2 were lower in winter \nand higher in summer/autumn and during the spring flood. No relationship was found between pCO2 and DIC \nor nutrients (Fig.\u00a0 9b, see Supplementary Material 2). The highest pCO2 and the lowest oxygen concentrations \nwere measured in anoxic wetlands, whereas the opposite was found in the Marne River reservoir, and overall, a negative relationship between pCO\n2 and dissolved oxygen was observed for all land uses (R2 = 0.22, n =  120, \np < 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 9c). We also found a positive relationship between pCO2 concentrations and Chl. a concentrations \n(R2 = 0.26, n = 113, p < 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 9d).\nFigure 6.

Chl. a concentrations in the reservoir were low (mean: 2.6 \u00b5g l\n\u22121) and DOC level was around 3.2 mgC l\u22121, \ni.e., with no sign of eutrophication (Fig.\u00a0 9a,d).\nDiscussion\npCO2 supersaturation of the Seine hydrosystem. Since the 1970s, the whole drainage network of the \nSeine basin has been supersaturated in pCO2 with respect to the atmospheric equilibrium. Supersaturation was \nobserved for 98.5% of computed pCO2 as well as for the direct field measurements. These results are in agreement \nwith those obtained in the lower reaches of other temperate rivers. In comparison to the mean of 3000 ppm at the outlet of the Seine basin, average pCO\n2 in the Meuse River (Belgium) on the period 2011\u20132014 was found \nequaling 2004 \u00b1 912 ppm and all samples were also supersaturated in CO2 (min. 971 ppm)14. Such variations can \nbe found within the Scheldt River estuary (Belgium) and measurements in five of its tributaries (Dender: 8300 ppm, Zenne: 5700 ppm, Dijle: 7252 ppm and Nete River: 6700 ppm, and an average of 9500 ppm for the lower Scheldt)\n36. Other Rivers as the Leyre (France) showed the same range of values (average: 4429 ppm, min.: 901 \nppm max.: 23,047 ppm)12. At the global scale, pCO2 in streams and rivers have been averaged at 1600 ppm in a \nrange of 132 to 11,770 ppm2. The wide range of pCO2 values in rivers were already mentioned with variations \nfrom 10 to 100 times the saturation value37.\nConversely, we measured undersaturation in the Marne reservoir with pCO2 below or near atmospheric equi-\nlibrium, in agreement with the results reported by Crawford et al .38 for river basins containing dam reservoirs. \nRiverine reservoirs have a higher residence time than the river itself, leading to particle sedimentation and a decrease in turbidity, conditions that favor primary production, i.e., consumption of CO\n2 and production of oxy-\ngen. During our field campaigns, we did not observe eutrophication conditions (Fig.\u00a0 9d) or relationships between \npCO2 and nutrients (see Supplementary Material 2). Without eutrophication of the reservoir, the biomass pro-\nduced does not form an organic load that would \u2013 paradoxically \u2013 consume O2 and release CO239.\npCO2 is known to be affected by metabolic processes related to nutrient availability40. In the Seine River, we \ncould have expected a relationship with ammonium (NH4+) as activated sludge treatment releases dissolved \norganic carbon and high ammonium load21. However, no direct relationship was found with NH4+ or other \nnutrients, which shows the complexity of the controls on pCO2 mentioned below.\nBecause the main stream of the Seine River was known for its phytoplankton blooms before domestic waste-\nwater was efficiently treated21,29, we analyzed bloom events (Fig.\u00a0 5) to try and identify possible short periods of \nundersaturation. Despite the fact we found evidence for the opposite pattern between phytoplankton (Chl. a) and pCO\n2 for phytoplankton blooms above 50 \u00b5g Chl. a l\u22121, the Seine River waters remained supersaturated.\nThis result supports the assumption that other environmental variables actively control pCO2 in the Seine \nRiver.\nHydro-climatic controls on pCO2. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 6, seasonal pCO2 concentrations (in the long term) \nvaried in parallel with temperature (i.e., with the highest values in summer/autumn) and opposite to hydrology. Such dynamics are typical for the temperate oceanic regime of the Seine River, with high discharge in winter and low discharge in summer/autumn\n41.\nHydro-climatic effects resulted from a combination of water temperature and hydrology leading to a seasonal \nincrease in pCO2 and CO2 evasion fluxes (fCO2) from winter to summer/autumn6,14. Indeed, the hypothesis of \ncontrol by water temperature is strengthened by the results of the field campaigns for different land uses with increasing pCO\n2 according to the season (pCO2 in winter < spring <  summer/autumn), which can be interpreted \nas an enhancement of DOC mineralization whatever the land use. However calculating pCO2 at 10 \u00b0C, revealed \nthat temperature effect on solubility is rather low. In addition, long term seasonal variations in pCO2 suggest \npossible control by hydrological regimes (high pCO2 in low flow periods). In fact, both water temperature and \nhydrological regimes (water velocity) contributed to the variations in the gas transfer velocity (k-values) , and \nthe associated fCO2. Moreover, for both k -values and fCO2 we demonstrated opposite seasonal patterns in the \nupstream and downstream parts of the Seine River system, differences that could be more attributed to water \nvelocities in small streams and water temperatures in higher stream orders (see equation\u00a0 4, Fig.\u00a0 4b\u2013d). Higher \nk-values  upstream, caused by higher turbulence, logically led to important CO2 outgassing compared to the lower \nk-values of the lower Seine River, down to its outlet.\nThe highest pCO2 values were measured during the exceptional flood when groundwater overflows may have \nreinforced pCO2 in the surface water. These high in-stream pCO2 levels were found concomitantly with high \nk-values (10\u201355% higher than levels measured in small streams in the other seasons) and would be expected to \nenhance CO2 evasion from rivers to the atmosphere. Similar effects of hydro-climatic conditions have also been \nobserved in the tropics, e.g., in a large Amazonian river with a 20% higher outgassing of CO2 during extreme \nflood years than in other years42, and in the Zambezi River, with pCO2 up to twofold higher during the wet sea-\nson43. Polsenaere and Abril (2012)44 compared two French streams and one river and observed that the stream \nwith the highest concentration of CO2 also had the highest CO2 degassing flux.\nSeveral authors have already suggested that climate change may alter the frequency and amplitude of flood \nevents in the Seine River basin, with more extreme hydrological conditions45\u201347, so that pCO2 and CO2 evasion \ncould increase in the future.\nControl of pCO2 by the soil organic carbon stock.  Analyzing in-stream pCO2 measured in the various \nupstream land uses as a function of DOC underlined the importance of soil organic carbon stocks as a controlling \nfactor. pCO2 and DOC were higher in streams draining wetlands and grasslands compared to those draining forests www.nature.com/scientificreports/11\nSCIEnTIFIC  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:13961  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32332-2and croplands (Figs\u00a0 3 and 9a ). According to Arrouays et al .48, the organic carbon stocks in croplands are less than \n4.5 kg C m\u22122, but reach nearly 7.0 kgC m\u22122 in grasslands and forests and around 9.0 kgC m\u22122 in wetlands. These \nvalues are consistent with the higher carbon sequestration rate of grasslands and wetlands:104 \u00b1 73 gC m2 year\u22121 \non average in Europe49. Thus, differences in pCO2 according to land use here can be explained by the drainage of \ndifferent organic soils and subsequent POC and DOC mineralization depending on water circulation and temper -\nature. This result is clearly illustrated by the flood event flushes during the growing season when DOC (spring flood \nDOC median: 11.44 mgC l\u22121) and pCO2 (spring flood median: 3297 ppm) reached their highest values.\nIn addition to the carbon leached from riparian zones and sediments, organic carbon can be leached from \nsoils where spring biological activity had already built up a large quantity of biomass that is potentially subject to mineralization.\nOrganic carbon quality has also been shown to influence pCO\n2 in streams in the North Central European \nplains in Germany and Poland50, and Belgium14,51. The biodegradable fraction of DOC is usually around 25% \nin upstream waters but may decrease to 5% in winter, and may be 50% in treated effluents16 (Garnier et al ., \nunpublished data). This supports lower observed pCO2 in winter and higher values linked to WWTP effluents. \nIncreasing biological mineralization of land-based organic matter (OM) in response to a rise in temperature52 \nduring the growing season, or increasing biodegradable DOC exports during high water or flood events53 appear \nto be two major driving factors of pCO2.\nDOC and pCO2 inputs originating from land runoff and/or aquifer base flow (i.e., diffuse sources), are added \nto inputs from wastewater effluents (i.e., point sources, as wastewaters treated in specific plants are well localized).\nControl of pCO2 by urban effluents: long term evidence. Whereas hydro-climatic conditions and \ndiffuse pCO2 and DOC inputs appeared to determine the seasonal variations in pCO2, long term changes in pCO2 \nobserved over 1970\u20132015 suggested control by point sources, which are known to dominate observed changes in the Seine River\n20,21,29,54. Indeed, the long-term annual pCO2 values in the urbanized main stream of the Seine \nRiver strictly mirror variations in releases of urban OM by the largest WWTP of the Paris conurbation. Until 1990, the wastewater collection rate was intensified but wastewater treatment was not improved\n55,56. Later on, the \nOM from discharged effluent decreased, with a stepwise increase in the number of WWTPs within the Parisian conurbation\n55 and improved treatment processes, in response to both the Urban Wastewater Directive (1991/271/\nEC) and the Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC). In 2012, the technique changed from activated sludge to fully operational tertiary treatment (nitrification in 2007 followed by 70% denitrification in 2012)\n21, \nand improved water quality in terms of organic pollution and nutrients. Subsequently, that helped in reducing pCO\n2 concentrations and enabled to recover acceptable levels of dissolved oxygen54 downstream of major urban \nreleases in the lower Seine an estuary. Because CO2 evasion pattern is likely to follow the pattern of pCO2 (see \nFigs\u00a0 3 and 4 ), our results would support those reported by Prasad et al .57. Indeed, they compared the urbanized \nAnacostia waters to the lower Potomac waters flowing into the Chesapeake Bay (U.S.A.), and showed similar effect of organic matter and nutrients from urbanized landscapes on CO\n2 evasion.\nWhatever the period studied during the last 45 years, point source organic pollution appeared to be the \nmain determinant of pCO2 downstream of the treated effluents discharged into the lower Seine River. However, \nhydro-climatic conditions also influence pCO2. For example, with no significant seasonal variations in OM fluxes \ndischarged as point sources, higher pCO2 concentrations in summer are explained by a low OM dilution rate \nduring low waters and high temperatures.\nLimits of the approach. The measurements we took in 2016 and 2017 showed neutral or basic carbonate \nbuffered waters and DOC average seasonal concentrations of 3.5 to 11.4 mgC l\u22121, excluding overestimation of \ncalculated pCO2 linked to the contribution of organic acids to TA12. Abril et al .12 also emphasized the importance \nof accurate pH measurements. We think that the variability we found when establishing the relationship between measured pCO\n2 and computed pCO2 (Fig.\u00a0 2) could be linked to the accuracy of pH measurements. As a result, \nthe long-term pCO2 analyses were subject to similar variability (see the 95% confidence intervals in Fig.\u00a0 8a). \nNevertheless, the amplitude of pCO2 variations over the 45 years period enabled a robust analysis.\nThe choice of computing k using one of the equations provided by Raymond et al .30 could lead to bias. Indeed \nthe equation was proposed based on measurements made on small streams (median depth, 0.28 m) and during \nlow flow (median discharge, 0.54 m3 s\u22121). We took into account slope, water velocity -discharge divided by the \nwetted cross section-  and water temperature, but not other physical or environmental factors causing turbulence in \nstreams, e.g., water turbidity, bed frictions, the direction and the intensity of wind, and chemical or bio-films30,44. \nAlthough there is need for direct measurements of k  in higher stream orders to reduce uncertainties in flux \ncalculations, k-values calculated for the Seine River range between 0.08 m h\u22121 (in winter for the main stem) and \n0.21 m h\u22121 (in winter for streams). k-values and patterns found for the Seine River are in agreement with k-values \nestimated for other large rivers (e.g., in New England, on the Upper Mississippi and the Upper Colorado Rivers30). \nRaymond et al.2 who averaged the k  of the entire drainage network (mixing large rivers and streams) by coastal \nsegmentation and related catchment regions (COSCAT)58 provided an annual k -value of 0.22 m h\u22121 for the region \nincluding the Seine River (COSCAT 401), close to the ones we used for streams. As small streams (SOs 1\u20134) rep-resent 91% of the surface area of the Seine drainage network (French water authorities, AESN), our k -values seem \nreasonable. In addition, main stem k -values calculated for the Seine basin are in the range of global estimations \nfound by Raymond et al .\n2, (median: 0.22 m h\u22121, min.: 0.07 m h\u22121, max: 1.43 m h\u22121).\nAt this stage, it is not possible to quantify the apportionment of pCO2 originating from carbonated groundwa-\nter from that resulting from carbon mineralization or WWTP inputs. The modelling approach in progress should provide quantitative insights and \u03b4\n13C-DOC/POC analysis could also be useful to identify the different sources \nof pCO244.www.nature.com/scientificreports/12\nSCIEnTIFIC  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:13961  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32332-2Conclusions\nThis study showed that since 1970, both small-order streams and urbanized downstream rivers in the Seine River \nbasin have been supersaturated in CO2 and a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. CO2 supersaturation with respect \nto the atmospheric equilibrium appeared to be controlled differently in space (depending on land uses or on the location of the main WWTP effluent discharge) and over time (seasonal or interannual). CO\n2 supersaturation \ndepended on complex interactions between land based and groundwater discharges (upstream diffuse sources), and urban pressures (downstream point sources) modulated by hydro-climatic factors.\nIn the small streams of the drainage network, in sparsely populated zones, the highest pCO\n2 in summer was \nshown to originate from mineralization (increasing with water temperatures) of organic carbon from diffuse sources including in-stream bottom sediments, riparian and/or terrestrial soils varying according to land uses. Hydro-climatic variations, especially water velocity in small streams greatly affected gas transfer velocity, and helped determine in-stream pCO\n2 (and evasion). During the exceptional flood event, high water discharges following a \nperiod of growth probably increased the DOC flushed from soils, leading to higher pCO2, especially in streams \ndraining wetlands and grasslands. High pCO2 in streams may be also linked to high pCO2 of groundwaters that \nfeed the surface water during low flow, and to the overflow of aquifers during floods, with particularly high pCO2.\nBased on the 1970\u20132015 time series, point source organic pollution appeared to be the main driver of pCO2 in \nthe lower Seine River, downstream of the main outlet of WWTP effluents, and whatever the period studied. pCO2 \nwas highest in summer during low waters and high temperatures, and lower in winter when the discharged efflu-ents were diluted. Despite the notable decrease in organic pollution following improvements in WWTPs since the 1990s, pCO\n2 has remained higher than atmospheric values, strongly suggesting the influence of carbonated \ngroundwater.\nIn the next step, a CO2 budget of the Seine drainage network will help (i) quantify the role played by temper -\nate human-impacted rivers in the global carbon budget, and (ii) estimate the amount of pCO2 point sources vs. \ndiffuse sources. The present study also points to the need for high frequency and more spatially resolved pCO2 \nvalues and direct measurements of k . In addition, to anticipate the impact of climate change with the expected \nextreme hydrological conditions, further research is needed to understand the interactions between the terrestrial (soils and their land-use), and aquatic (hydrosystems\n59, groundwater discharges) compartments of watersheds.\nData Availability\nThe datasets generated during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable re -\nquest.\nReferences\n 1.

In this  correspondence,  the  spline \nand  the  discrete  Fourier  transforms  (DFT) \nare  compared as means for numerical com- \nputation of the  Fourier  integral  transform. It \nis shown how the  spline  transform  reduces \nerrors  introduced  by  the  discrete  transform \nand alleviates  noise  problems when the  sam- \npling rate is limited  due to experimental \nmethod or hardware  constraints. \nThe problems of aliasing, or frequency \nfoldover, and noise corruption  are well \nknown when the discrete Fourier  trans- \nform  (DFT) of continuous  data is in- \nvolved [l], [4]. The aliasing problem \ncan usually  be avoided by choosing a \nsufficiently  high sampling rate based \nupon  the Nyquist sampling principle and \nupon examination of the power spectral \ndensity of the  data,  or by bandpass \nfiltering the  data before sampling, or \nboth. \nWhen the sampling rate  is limited, the \naliasing and noise problems are  treated \nin  a consistent fashion by the  interpolat- \ning  and  smoothing spline functions.  The \nmethods \u201cfill in\u201d the  functional values \nbetween sample points  and can compen- \nsate,  in  computing the spectrum, for low \nsampling rate while smoothing  or filter- \ning  the  data to reduce noise  effects. Also, \nthe effect of these methods  on  the result- \nManuscript received  February 19, 1970; \nrevised  September 28, 1970. the DFT, as shown in  the foliowing dis- \ncussion. \nThe  mathematical spline function is \ndesigned to perform a service similar to \nthe draftsman\u2019s spline in drawing \nsmooth curves [2]. Let samples of data \nbe {yp],p=O,l, . . - ,n+l andassume \nthat xp=ph where h  is  the sampling in- \nterval. In  the interval (xp, xPtl), the \nmodel  is chosen as an mth  order poly- \nnomial with  coefficients {mkp }, k = 0, 1, \n2, - . - , m. The complete model  struc- \nture consists of a set of n polynomials \nand  has  the  form \nwhere \nR(x) = 1 l,O<x<h \n0, elsewhere. \nThe coefficients { Cfkp } are chosen to  ap- \nproximate a  continuous (noise cor- \nrupted)  function of x having sample \nvalues {yp } . It should be noted  that  the \nerror between the  data samples and  the \nspline functions  can be made zero at all \nthe sample points by choosing olop=yp, \nall p. However, the consequences may \nnot be  very satisfying even though  the fit \nat sample points is perfect because g(x) \nwill reflect  fully any  fluctuations  in the \ndata samples due to noise. \nIn practice, third  order, or cubic, poly- \nnomials (rn = 3) are often used, and some \nform of data  smoothing  or filtering may \nbe included. For example, the coeffi- \ncients { } may  be  chosen to give the \nsmoothest curve subject to  an  upper \nbound  on  the mean-square error between 1 \nJW r&) = [krk-l(w) - hke-irh], \nk > 0. (3) \nEquation (2) shows that  the spline trans- \nform G(w) is  a weighted sum of m+l \nDFT, each on a set of n polynomial \ncoefficients. \nOne  means of interpreting  the differ- \nence  between the spline transform  and \nthe DFT is to recognize that  the  DFT in- \nvolves approximation  to g(x)e-iuz, while \nthe spline method involves approxirna- \ntion only to g(x). \nNoise  and Approximation Errors \nThe  manner  in which  coefficients \n(Cfkp } are chosen determines the noise \nreducing properties of the  method. Two \napplications follow which allow a com- \nparison with DFT methods. \nThe first application involves coeffi- \ncients which are linear x-invariant func- \ntions (or  moving averages) of the  data \nsamples: \nakP = C ~kiy~-i all k, P. (4) \nA straight-line model structure (m= 1) \nthat fits through  all  data  points,  requires \nthe  nonzero coefficients to be \nPo0 = 1 \nPL(-I) = 1/h \nPlo = -l/h. \nWith  the  aid of (4), the DFT terms in \n(2) can be rewritten: \na,cpe-iwzp \nP \nthe curve and  the  data  points.  This  is a Upon defining the DFT Bk(w)= \nstraightforward minimization problem Cifikie-jwzi and  substitution of (5) and with constraints, which can be solved Bk(w) into (2), one obtains \nusing Lagrangian multipliers. \nThe Numerical Transform \nThe exact transform of the  function \ng(x) in (1) is given in (2). Since a DFT \nis not used, no aliasing (frequency fold- \nover) problem will occur in the  trans- \nformation of &x): \nThe  integral  in  brackets  in (2) is  the \nFourier  transform of x]c in  the  interval \n(0, h) and is denoted  as rk(0). Values for r&) are given by the following equa- \ntions. G(w) = I\u2018k(u)Bk(w) ype-iwz~j . (6) \nEquation (6) indicates that  the spline \ntransform  in  the present case is  the  prod- \nuct  of a DFT of the  data samples and \na frequency function which accounts  for \nsmoothing  and  interpolation. Clearly, \nthe interpolating filter  may  be  used in \nplace  of or in conjunction with other \nfilters or windows [l]. \nAs an  illustration,  the  function f(x) \n=(1 -e-\u201d)  was sampled, O<x<3, with \nsampling interval h = 0.05. A transform \nof the derivative was determined using \nthe spline-function method as follows. i, \nIEEE TRANSACTlONS ON AUDIO AND ELECTROAC :OUSTIC~ MARCM 1971 103 Each sample and its  two adjacent sam- \nples  were fitted with a quadratic func- \ntion. Differentiation  of each quadratic \nfunction yielded  a linear spline function \nin the region kh/2 about  the corre- \nsponding sample. In this case, the spline \nfunction is  defined in an interval 5 h/2 \nabout each sample point. The resulting \nspectrum is  shown in Fig. 1. For com- \nparison, the DFT Gs(w) of the samples \nof ecX is also shown. \nThe improvement in this case in using \nthe spline functions is  clearly  evident in \nFig. 1. By increasing the  order of the \nspline functions and obtaining a better \nfit  of g(x), still further improvement in \nthe spectrum would be observed. This is \ntrue since the x-domain  error is  directly \nrelated to the transform-domain error \nby Parseval\u2019s theorem: \nAs the left-hand  side  of (7) is reduced, \nthe  transform integral square  error will \nalso be reduced. \nThe second application is  based on a \ncriterion of smoothness of the spline \nfunctions and  on smoothed curve fitting \nof data [3]. The coefficients (ahp} are \nchosen to minimize the \u201croughness\u201d R, \nwhich  is  defined as \nR = zn [g\u201d(~)]~d~ \nzn \u2018....

An advantage of this \nmethod is that  the derivative of the spline \nfunction approximation is continuous. \nA computer program  for the minimum \nroughness criterion has been written \nand used  successfully. \nwhere (\u201c) denotes the second  derivative. \nThe smoothest curve (R = 0) is always  a \nstraight line.  However, an upper bound \nis additionally placed upon  the mean- \nsquare  error between the  data samples \nand g(x). The lowest upper bound is an \nerror of zero, in which  case the  error be- \ntween the  data  and g(~) is zero at every \nsample point. \n.From the transform g\u201d(x)+-w*G(w) \nand Parseval\u2019s theorem, the roughness is \ndescribed in  the transform domain as @) Computational  Efkiency \nThe right-hand side  of (9) shows that \nthe criterion fends to suppress high- \nfrequency content for mean-square error \nconstraint. \nThe criterion is used to determine the \npolynomial coefficients and  the trans- \nform  is determined from the coefficients The solution of (6) for  the spline- \nfunction transform requires specification \nof the filter xk rk(w)Bh(w) and compu- \ntation of the DFT of the  data samples, \nas might be expected in any  Fourier \nanalysis method. \nIf (2) is  used, computational efficiency \nis  sacrificed for more flexibility in choos- \ning spline-function  coefficients. For \nexample, in using  cubic  spline functions, \nfour filters are specified, four DFTs are \ncomputed, and  the spline function coeffi- \ncients must also be determined. \nConclusion \nBy examination of (2) and (6), it may \nbe seen that  the effect  of the spline trans- \nform  is to provide a correction to  the \nDFT. Other corrective  measures to ac- \ncount  for x-domain truncation  are com- \nmonly  used  (e.g., Hamming window). \nThe spline functions provide a correction \nfor sampling effects, as well as allowing \nfor noise reduction.

Care has been taken to include only those formulas and tables which are most likely to be needed in practice, rather than highly spe -\ncialized results which are rarely used. It is a \u201cuser-friendly\u201d handbook with material mostly rooted in university \nmathematics and scientific courses. In fact, the first edition can already be found in many libraries  and offices, \nand it most likely has moved with the owners from office to office since their college times. Thus, this handbook has survived the test of time (while most other college texts have been thrown away).\nThis new edition maintains the same spirit as previous editions, with the following changes. First of all, \nwe have deleted some out-of-date tables which can now be easily obtained from a simple calculator, and we have deleted some rarely used formulas. The main change is that sections on Probability and Random Variables \nhave been expanded with new material. These sections appear in both the physical and social sciences, including education. There are also two new sections: Section XIII on Turing Machines and Section XIV on Mathematical Finance.\nTopics covered range from elementary to advanced. Elementary topics include those from algebra, ge om-\netry, trigonometry, analytic geometry, probability and statistics, and calculus. Advanced topics include those from differential equations, numerical analysis, and vector analysis, such as Fourier series, gamma and beta functions, Bessel and Legendre functions, Fourier and Laplace transforms, and elliptic and other special func -\ntions of importance. This wide coverage of topics has been adopted to provide, within a single volume, most of the important mathematical results needed by student and research workers, regardless of their particular field of interest or level of attainment.\nThe book is divided into two main parts. Part A presents mathematical formulas together with other mate -\nrial, such as definitions, theorems, graphs, diagrams, etc., essential for proper understanding and application of the formulas. Part B presents the numerical tables. These tables include basic statistical distributions (normal, Student\u2019s t, chi-square, etc.), advanced functions (Bessel, Legendre, elliptic, etc.), and financial functions (com -\npound and present value of an amount, and annuity).\nMcGraw-Hill Education wishes to thank the various authors and publishers\u2014for example, the Literary \nExecutor of the late Sir Ronald A. Fisher, F.R.S., Dr. Frank Yates, F.R.S., and Oliver and Boyd Ltd., Edinburgh, for Table III of their book Statistical Tables for Biological, Agricultural and Medical Research \u2014who gave their \npermission to adapt data from their books for use in several tables in this handbook. Appropriate references to such sources are given below the corresponding tables.\nFinally, I wish to thank the staff of McGraw-Hill Education Schaum\u2019s Outline Series, especially Diane \nGrayson, for their unfailing cooperation.\nSeymour Lipschutz\nTemple University\n00_Spiegel Math_FM_i-xii.indd   5 31/08/17   12:19 pm00_Spiegel Math_FM_i-xii.indd   6 31/08/17   12:19 pmThis page intentionally left blank viiContents\nPart A FORMULAS  1\nSection I  Elementary Constants,  Products, Formulas  3\n 1.

Specifically, we let the point ( a, b) in the plane represent the complex number z = a + bi. For \nexample, the point P in Fig. 4-1 represents the complex number z = -3 + 4i.

Functions\nIf x = sin y, then y = sin\u20131x, i.e. the angle whose sine is x or inverse sine of x  is a many-valued function of x \nwhich is a collection of single-valued functions called branches. Similarly, the other inverse trigonometric \nfunctions are multiple-valued.\nFor many purposes a particular branch is required. This is called the principal branch and the values for \nthis branch are called principal values.\n03_Spiegel_section III_043-061.indd   49 30/08/17   12:11 pm50 Trigonome Tric Func Tions\nPrincipal Values for Inverse Trigonometric Functions\nPrincipal values for x \u2267 0 Principal values for x < 0\n0 \u2266 sin\u20131 x \u2266 p/2 \u2013p/2 \u2266 sin\u20131 x < 0\n0 \u2266 cos\u20131 x \u2266 p/2 p/2 < cos\u20131 x \u2266 p\n0 \u2266 tan\u20131 x < p/2 \u2013p/2 < tan\u20131 x < 0\n0 < cot\u20131 x \u2266 p/2 p/2 < cot\u20131 x < p\n0 \u2266 sec\u20131 x < p/2 p/2 < sec\u20131 x \u2266 p\n0 < csc\u20131 x \u2266 p/2 \u2013p/2 \u2266 csc\u20131 x < 0\nRelations Between Inverse Trigonometric Functions\nIn all cases it is assumed that principal values are used.\n12.74.  sinc os /211xx \u03c0 +=\u2212\u2212 12.80.  sin( )s in11xx\u2212= \u2212\u2212\u2212\n12.75.  tanc ot /211xx \u03c0 +=\u2212\u2212 12.81.  cos( )c os11xx\u03c0 \u2212= \u2212\u2212\u2212\n12.76.  secc sc /211xx \u03c0 +=\u2212\u2212 12.82.  tan( )t an11xx\u2212= \u2212\u2212\u2212\n12.77.  cscs in(1/)11xx=\u2212\u2212 12.83.  cot( )c ot11xx\u03c0 \u2212= \u2212\u2212\u2212\n12.78.  secc os(1/)11xx=\u2212\u2212 12.84.  sec( )s ec11xx\u03c0 \u2212= \u2212\u2212\u2212\n12.79.  cott an(1/)11xx=\u2212\u2212 12.85.  csc( )c sc11xx\u2212= \u2212\u2212\u2212\nGraphs of Inverse Trigonometric Functions\nIn each graph y is in radians.

The sine of any middle part equals the product of the cosines of the opposite parts.\nEXAMPLE : Since co-A = 90\u00b0 \u2013 A, co-B = 90\u00b0 \u2013 B, we have\n sin a = tan b (co-B ) or sin a = tan b cot B\n sin (co- A) = cos a cos (co-B ) or cos A = cos a sin B\nThese can of course be obtained also from the results of 12.97.\n03_Spiegel_section III_043-061.indd   52 30/08/17   12:12 pm5313  EXPONENTIAL and LOGARITHMIC  \nFUNCTIONS\nLaws of Exponents\nIn the following p, q are real numbers, a, b are positive numbers, and m, n are positive integers.\n13.1.  aa apq pq\u22c5=+ 13.2.  /aa apq pq=\u2212 13.3.

Such \nquantities are called scalars.\nOther quantities such as force, velocity, and momentum require for their specification a direction as well \nas magnitude. Such quantities are called vectors. A vector is represented by an arrow or directed line \nsegment indicating direction. The magnitude of the vector is determined by the length of the arrow, using an appropriate unit.\nNotation for Vectors\nA vector is denoted by a bold faced letter such as A (Fig. 20-1). The magnitude is denoted by | A| or A. The \ntail end of the arrow is called the initial point, while the head is called the terminal point.\nFundamental Definitions\n1.  Equality of vectors.  Two vectors are equal if they have the same  \nmagnitude and direction. Thus, A = B in (Fig. 20-1).\n2.  Multiplication of a vector by a scalar.  If m is any real number  \n(scalar), then m A is a vector whose magnitude is |m | times the  \nmagnitude of A  and whose direction is the same as or opposite  \nto A according as m  > 0 or m  < 0. If m  = 0, then m A = 0 is called  \nthe zero or null vector.\n3.  Sums of vectors.  The sum or resultant of A and B  is a vector C  = A + B formed by placing the \ninitial point B on the terminal point A and joining the initial point of A to the terminal point of B as \nin Fig. 20-2b. This definition is equivalent to the parallelogram law for vector addition as indicated in Fig. 20-2c. The vector A - B is defined as A + (-B).\nFig. 20-2\nExtension to sums of more than two vectors are immediate. Thus, Fig. 20-3 shows how to obtain the sum E \nof the vectors A, B, C, and D.Fig. 20-1\n05_Spiegel_section V_116-133.indd   119 30/08/17   7:48 pm120 FORmULAS  FROm VEcT OR ANALySIS\nFig. 20-3\n4.  Unit vectors.  A unit vector is a vector with unit magnitude. If A is a vector, then a unit vector in the \ndirection of A is a = A/A where A > 0.\nLaws of Vector Algebra\nIf A, B, C are vectors and m, n are scalars, then:\n 20.1.  A + B = B + A Commutative law for addition\n 20.2.  A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C Associative law for addition\n 20.3.  m(nA) = (mn)A = n(mA)  Associative law for scalar multiplication\n 20.4.  (m + n)A = mA + n A Distributive law\n 20.5.  m(A + B) = mA + m B Distributive law\nComponents of a Vector\nA vector A  can be represented with initial point at the  \norigin of a rectangular coordinate system. If i , j, k are unit  \nvectors in the directions of the positive x, y, z axes, then\n 20.6.  A = A1i + A2j + A3k \nwhere A1i, A2j, A3k are called component vectors of A in \nthe i, j, k directions and A1, A2, A3 are called the components  \nof A.\nDot or Scalar Product\n 20.7.

We distinguish these two cases using different notation as follows:\nn = number of items in a sample, \n        N = number of items in the population,\n x = (read: x-bar) =  sample mean,  m (read: mu) = population mean,\n  s2 = sample variance,  s\u2009\u20092 = population variance,\n   s = sample standard deviation,  s  = population standard deviation\nNote that Greek letters are used with the population and are called parameters, whereas Latin letters are \nused with the samples and are called statistics. First we give formulas for the data coming from a sample. \nThis is followed by formulas for the population.\nGrouped Data\nFrequently, the sample data are collected into groups (grouped data). A group refers to a set of numbers \nall with the same value xi, or a set (class) of numbers in a given interval with class value xi. In such a case, we \nassume there are k groups with fi denoting the number of elements in the group with value or class value xi. \nThus, the total number of data items is\n39.1.  nfi\u2211=\nAs usual, \u03a3 will denote a summation over all the values of the index, unless otherwise specified.\nAccordingly, some of the formulas will be designated as (a) or as (b), where (a) indicates ungrouped data \nand (b) indicates grouped data.\nMeasures of Central Tendency\nMean (Arithmetic Mean)\nThe arithmetic mean or simply mean of a sample x1, x2,\u2026, xn, frequently called the \u201caverage value,\u201d is the \nsum of the values divided by the number of values. That is:\n39.2(a).  Sample mean:        \uf04cxxx x\nnx\nnn i 12=++ +=\u03a3\n39.2(b).

The median of the data, denoted by\n  Mor/uni00A0/uni00A0Median\nis defined to be the \u201cmiddle value. \u201d That is:\n11_Spiegel_section XI_208-216.indd   208 30/08/17   12:23 pmDescriptive statistics  209\n39.3(a).  xn nk\nxxnn kk\nkkMedianwhen isoddand2 1,\n2when iseven an d2 .1\n1==+\n+=\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\uf8f4+\n+\nThe median  of grouped data is obtained by first finding the cumulative frequency  function Fs.

First one finds the median class m, \nthe class with the median value, and then one linearly interpolates in the class using the formula\n39.3(b. 2). LcnF\nfmm\nmMedian(/2)1=+\u2212\u2212\nwhere Lm denotes the lower class boundary of the median class and c denotes its class width (length of the \nclass interval).\nMode\nThe mode is the value or values which occur most often. Namely:\n39.4.  Mode xm = numerical value that occurs the most number of times\nThe mode is not defined if every xm occurs the same number of times, and when the mode is defined it \nmay not be unique.\nWeighted and grand means\nSuppose that each xi is assigned a weight wi \u2265 0.

Then the \ngrand mean, denoted by xi is the \u201cmean of the means\u201d where each mean is weighted by the number of ele -\nments in its sample. Specifically:\n39.6.

The sample space S itself is called the certain event, and the null set \u2205 is called the impossible \nevent.\nIt would be convenient if all subsets of S could be events. Unfortunately, this may lead to contradictions \nwhen a probability function is defined on the events. Thus, the events are defined to be a limited collection \nC of subsets of S as follows.\nDEFINITION 40.1:  The class C of events of a sample space S form a \u03c3-field. That is, C has the following \nthree properties:  \n(i) S \u2208 C.\n(ii) If A1, A2, \u2026 belong to C, then their union A1 \u222a A2 \u222a A3 \u222a \u2026 belongs to C. \n(iii) If A \u2208 C, then its complement Ac \u2208 C. \nAlthough the above definition does not mention intersections, DeMorgan\u2019s law (40.3) tells us that the \ncomplement of a union is the intersection of the complements. Thus, the events form a collection that is closed under unions, intersections, and complements of denumerable sequences.\nIf S is finite, then the class of all subsets of S form a \u03c3-field. However, if S is nondenumerable, then only \ncertain subsets of S can be the events. In fact, if B is the collection of all open intervals on the real line R, \nthen the smallest \u03c3-field containing B is the collection of Borel sets in R.\nIf Condition (ii) in Definition 40.1 of a \u03c3-field is replaced by finite unions, then the class of subsets of S \nis called a field. Thus a \u03c3-field is a field, but not visa versa. \nFirst, for completeness, we list basic properties of the set operations of union, intersection, and complement.\n40.1.\n Sets satisfy the properties in Table 40-1.\nTABLE 40-1   Laws of the Algebra of Sets\nIdempotent laws:  (1a)  A \u222a A = A  (1b)  A \u2229 A = A\nAssociative laws:  (2a)  (A \u222a B) \u222a C = A \u222a (B \u222a C) (2b)  (A \u2229 B) \u2229 C = A \u2229 (B \u2229  C)\nCommutative laws:  (3a)  A \u222a B = B \u222a A (3b)  A \u2229 B = B \u2229 A\nDistributive laws:  (4a)  A \u222a (B \u2229  C) = (A \u222a B) \u2229 (A \u222a C)  (4b)  A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 B) \nIdentity laws:  (5a)  A \u222a \u2205 =  A (5b)  A \u2229 U = A \n (6a)  A \u222a U = U   (6b)  A \u2229 \u2205 = \u2205\nInvolution law:  (7)  (AC)C = A\nComplement laws:  (8a)  A \u222a Ac = U (8b)  A \u2229 Ac = \u2205\n (9a)  Uc = \u2205  (9b)  \u2205c = U\nDeMorgan\u2019s laws:  (10a)  (A  \u222a B)c = Ac \u2229 Bc  (10b)  (A  \u2229 B)c = Ac \u222a Bc \n11_Spiegel_section XI_217-230.indd   217 31/08/17   10:50 am218  PROBABILITY\n40.2.

Find the probability that \n (a) the same horse wins all three times\n (b) each horse wins once\n(a) Writing xyz for (x, y, z), we seek the probability of the event A = {aaa, bbb, ccc}. Here,\nP(aaa) = (0.2)3 = 0.008, P(bbb) = (0.3)3 = 0.027, P(ccc) = (0.5)3 = 0.125\n   Thus, P(A) = 0.008 + 0.027 + 0.125 = 0.160.\n(b)  We seek the probability of the event B = {abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba}. Each element in B has the same \nprobability (0.2)(0.3)(0.5) = 0.03.

A random variable X on the sample space S is a function from S into the set R of real numbers \nsuch that the preimage of every interval of R is an event of S. \nIf S is a discrete sample space in which every subset of S is an event, then every real-valued function on \nS is a random variable. On the other hand, if S is uncountable, then certain real-valued functions on S may \nnot be random variables.\nLet X be a random variable on S, where we let RX denote the range of X; that is,\nRX = {x | there exists s \u2208 S for which X(s) = x}\nThere are two cases that we treat separately. (i) X is a discrete random variable; that is, RX is finite or \ncountable. (ii) X is a continuous random variable; that is, RX is a continuum of numbers such as an interval \nor a union of intervals. \nLet X and Y be random variables on the same sample space S. Then, as usual, X + Y, X + k, kX, and XY \n(where k is a real number) are the functions on S defined as follows (where s is any point in S):\n(X + Y)(s) = X(s) +  Y(s),   (kX)(s) = kX(s),\n  (X + k)(s) = X(s) +  k,    (XY)(s) = X(s)Y(s).\nMore generally, for any polynomial, exponential, or continuous function h(t), we define h(X) to be the \nfunction on S defined by\n[h(X)](s) = h[X(s)]\nOne can show that these are also random variables on S.The following short notation is used:\n P(X = xi)  denotes the probability that X = xi.\n P(a \u2264 X \u2264  b denotes the probability that X lies in the closed interval [a, b].\n X\u00b5 or E(X) or simply \u00b5  denotes the mean or expectation of X.\n X2\u03c3 or Var(X) or simply 2\u03c3  denotes the variance of X.\n X\u03c3 or simply \u03c3  denotes the standard deviation of X.\nSometimes we let Y be a random variable such that Y = g(X), that is, where Y is some function of X.\nDiscrete Random Variables\nHere X is a random variable with only a finite or countable number of values, say\nRX = {x1, x2, x3, \u2026}where, say, x1 < x2, < x3 < \u2026. Then X induces a function f(x) on RX as follows:\nf(xi) = P(X = xi) = P({s \u2208 S | X(s) = xi})\nThe function f(x) has the following properties:\n(i) f(xi) \u2265 0  and  (ii) i\u03a3 f(xi) = 1\nThus, f defines a probability function on the range RX of X. The pair (xi, f(xi)), usually given by a table, \nis called the probability distribution or probability mass function of X.\n11_Spiegel_section XI_217-230.indd   223 31/08/17   10:50 am224  RANDOM  V ARIABLES\nMean\n41.1.

The tape is divided lengthwise into squares (cells), and each square may be blank or hold one tape symbol. \nAt each step in time, the Turing machine M is in a certain internal state si scanning one of the tape symbols aj \non the tape. We assume that only a finite number of nonblank symbols appear on the tape.\nFigure 49-1(a ) is a picture of a Turing machine M in state s2 scanning the second symbol where a1a3Ba1 a1 \nis printed on the tape. (Note again that B is the blank symbol.) This picture may be represented by the expres -\nsion a  = a1s2a3Ba1a1, where we write the state s2 of M before the tape symbol a3 that M is scanning. Observe \nthat a is an expression using only the tape alphabet A except for the state symbol s2, which is not at the end \nof the expression since it appears before the tape symbol a3 that M is scanning. Figure 49-1 shows two other \ninformal pictures and their corresponding picture expressions.\nFig. 49-1\nWe give formal definitions.\nDefinition 49.1:  A picture a is an expression as follows where P and Q are tape expressions (possibly \nempty):\na = PsiakQ\nDefinition 49.2:  Let a = PsiakQ be a picture. We say that the Turing machine M is in state si scanning the \nletter ak and that the expression on the tape is the expression PakQ, that is, without its state symbol si.\n13_Spiegel_section XIII_246-253.indd   247 31/08/17   10:52 am24850   QUINTUPLE, TURING MACHINE\nAs mentioned above, at each step in time the Turing machine M is in a certain state si and is scanning a tape \nsymbol ak. The Turing machine M is able to do the following three things simultaneously:\n (i) M erases the scanned symbol ak and writes a tape symbol al (where we permit al = ak) in its place.\n (ii) M changes its internal state si to a state sj (where we permit sj = sj).\n (iii) M moves one square to the left or one square to the right.\nQuintuple\nThe above action by M may be described by a five-letter expression called a quintuple, which we define \nbelow.\nDefinition 50.1:  A quintuple q is a five-letter expression of the following form:\nqs aa sL\nRik lj ,, ,, =\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fe\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nTuring Machine\nThat is, the first letter of q is a state symbol, the second is a tape symbol, the third is a tape symbol, the fourth \nis a state symbol, and the last is a direction symbol L or R.\nNext we give a formal definition of a Turing machine.\nDefinition 50.2:  A Turing machine M is a finite set of quintuples such that:\n (i) No two quintuples begin with the same first two letters. \n (ii) No quintuple begins with sH, sY, or sN.\nCondition (i) in the definition guarantees that the machine M cannot do more than one thing at any given \nstep, and condition (ii) guarantees that M halts in state sH, sY, or sN.\nThe following is an alternative equivalent definition.\nDefinition 50.2\u2032:  Turing machine M is a partial function from\nS \\{sH, sY or sN} \u00d7 A into A \u00d7 S \u00d7 d\nThe term partial function simply means that the domain of M is a subset of S \\{sH, sY, or sN} \u00d7 A.\nAction of Turing Machine\nThe action of the Turing machine described above can now be formally defined.\nDefinition 50.3:  Let a and b be pictures. We write\na \u2192 b\n13_Spiegel_section XIII_246-253.indd   248 31/08/17   10:52 amQuintuple, turing Machine  249\nif one of the following holds where a, b, and c are tape letters, and P and Q are tape expressions (possibly \nempty):\n (i) a = Psi acQ, b = PbsjcQ, and M contains the quintuple q = siabsj R.\n (ii) a = PcsiaQ, b = PsjcbQ, and M contains the quintuple q = siabsj L. \n (iii) a = Psia, b = PbsjB, and M contains the quintuple q = siabsj R.\n (iv) a = siaQ, b = sjBbQ, and M contains the quintuple q = siabsj L.\nObserve that, in all four cases, M replaces a on the tape with b (where we permit b = a), and M changes \nits state from si to sj (where we permit sj = si). Furthermore:\n (i) Here M moves to the right.\n (ii) Here M moves to the left.\n (iii)  Here M moves to the right; however, since M is scanning the rightmost letter, it must add the blank \nsymbol B on the right.\n (iv)  Here M moves to the left; however, since M  is scanning the leftmost letter, it must add the blank \nsymbol B on the left.\nDefinition 50.4:  A picture a is said to be terminal if there is no picture b such that a \u2192 b.\nIn particular, any picture a in one of the three halt states must be terminal since no quintuple begins with \nsH, sY, or sn.\n13_Spiegel_section XIII_246-253.indd   249 31/08/17   10:52 am25051  COMPUTING WITH A TURING MACHINE\nThe above is a static (one-step) description of a Turing machine M. Now we discuss its dynamics.\nDefinition 51.1:  A computation of a Turing machine M is a sequence of pictures a1, a2 ,\u2026, am such that  \nai-1 \u2192 ai, for i = 1, 2, \u2026, m, and am is a terminal picture.\nIn other words, a computation is a sequence\na0 \u2192 a1 \u2192 a2 \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 am\nthat cannot be extended since am is terminal. We will let term(a) denote the final picture of a computation \nbeginning with a. Thus term(a0) = am in the above computation.\nTuring Machines with Input\nThe following definition applies.\nDefinition 51.2:  An input for a Turing machine M is a tape expression W. The initial picture for an input W \nis a\u2009(W) where a\u2009 (W ) = s0 (W).\nObserve that the initial picture a\u2009(W) of the input W is obtained by placing the initial state s0, in front of \nthe input tape expression W. In other words, the Turing machine M begins in its initial state s0, and it is scan -\nning the first letter of W.Definition 51.3:\n Let M be a Turing machine, and let W be an input. We say M halts on W  if there is a \ncomputation beginning with the initial picture a\u2009 (W).\nThat is, given an input W , we can form the initial picture a (W ) = s0 (W) and apply M to obtain the sequence\na\u2009(W) \u2192 a1 \u2192 a2 \u2192 \u2026\nTwo things can happen:\n (1) M halts on W. That is, the sequence ends with some terminal picture ar.\n (2) M does not halt on W. That is, the sequence never ends.\nComputable Functions\nComputable functions are defined on the set of nonnegative integers. Some texts use N to denote this set. We \nuse N to denote the set of positive integers, so we will use the notation\nN0 = {0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026}\nThroughout this section, the terms number , integer , and nonnegative integer  are used synonymously. Here we \nshow how M manipulates numerical data. First, however, we need to be able to represent our numbers with \nour tape set A. We will write 1 for the tape symbol a1 and 1n for 111 \u2026 1, where 1 occurs n times.\nDefinition 51.4:  Each number n will be represented by the tape expression \u2329n\u232a where \u2329n\u232a = 1n+1. Thus,\n\u23294\u232a = 11111 = 15,  \u23290\u232a =  1,  \u23292\u232a = 111 = 13.\n13_Spiegel_section XIII_246-253.indd   250 31/08/17   10:52 amcoMputing with a turing Machine  251\nDefinition 51.5:  Let E be an expression. Then [E] will denote the number of times 1 occurs in E. Thus,\n[11Bs2 a3 111Ba4] = 5,  [a4s2Ba2] = 0,  [\u2329n\u232a] = n + 1.\nDefinition 51.6:  A function f: N0 \u2192 N0 is computable if there exists a Turing machine M such that, for \nevery integer n, M halts on \u2329n\u232a and\nf(n) = [term(a\u2009 (\u2329n\u232a)].\nWe then say that M computes f.\nThat is, given a function f  and an integer n , we input \u2329 n\u232a and apply M . If M  always halts on \u2329 n\u232a and the num -\nber of 1s in the final picture is equal to f (n), then  f  is a computable function, and we say that M  computes f .\n13_Spiegel_section XIII_246-253.indd   251 31/08/17   10:52 am25252  EXAMPLES\nExample 1:  Let M be a Turing machine. Determine the picture a corresponding to each situation:\n(a) M is in state s3 and scanning the third letter of the tape expression w = aabca.\n(b) M is in state s2 and scanning the last letter of the tape expression w = abca.\n(c) The input is the tape expression w = 14B12.\n The picture a is obtained by placing the state symbol before the tape letter being scanned. Initially, M \nis in state s0 scanning the first letter of an input. Thus,\n(a) a = aas3bca;  (b) a = abcs2a;  (c) a = s01111B11.\nExample 2:  Suppose a = aas2ba is a picture. Find b such that a \u2192 b if the Turing machine M has the \nquintuple q where (a) q = s2bas1L; (b) q = s2bbs3R; (c) q = s2bas2R; and (d) q = s3abs1L.\n (a) Here M erases b and writes a, changes its state to s1, and moves left. Thus, b = as1aaa.\n (b)  Here M does not change the scanned letter b, changes its state to s3, and moves right. Thus,  \nb = aabs3a.\n (c) Here M erases b and writes a, keeps its state s2, and moves right. Thus, b = aaas2a.\n (d) Here q has no effect on a since q does not begin with s2b.\nComputable Functions\nExample 3:  Find \u2329m\u232a if (a) m = 5; (b) m = (4, 0, 3); and (c) m = (3, -2, 5).\n Recall \u2329n\u232a = 1n+1 = 11n and \u2329(n1, n2, \u2026 nr )\u232a = \u2329n1\u232a B \u2329n2\u232aB \u2026 B\u2329nr\u232a. Thus,\n(a) \u2329m\u232a = 16 = 111111.\n(b) \u2329m\u232a = 15B11B14 = 11111B1B1111.\n(c) \u2329m\u232a is not defined for negative integers.\nExample 4:  Find [ E] for the expressions:\n(a) E = alls2Bb111; (c) E = \u2329m\u232a where m = (4, 1, 2);\n(b) E = aas3bb; (d) E = \u2329m\u232a where m = (n1, n2, \u2026, nr).\nRecall that [E] counts the number of 1s in E. Thus,\n(a) [E] = 5; (b) [E] = 0; (c) [E] = 10 since E = 15B12B13;\n(d) [E] = n1 + n2 + \u2026 + nr + r since the number of 1s contributed by each nk to E is nk + 1.\nExample 5:   The function f (n) = n + 3 is computable. The input is W = 1n+1. Thus we need only add two 1\u2019s \nto the input. A Turing machine M that computes f follows\nM = {q1, q2, q3} = {s0 1s0L, s0B1s1L, s1B1sHL}\n Observe that:\n (1) q1 moves the machine M to the left.\n (2) q2 writes 1 in the blank square B and moves M to the left.\n (3) q3 writes 1 in the blank square B and halts M.\n13_Spiegel_section XIII_246-253.indd   252 31/08/17   10:52 ameXaMpleS 253\nAccordingly, for any positive integer n,\ns01n+1 \u2192 s0B1n+1 \u2192 s1B1n+2 \u2192 sHB1n+3.\nThus M computes f(n) = n + 3. It is clear that, for any positive integer k, the function f(n) = n + k is \ncomputable.\nExample 6:   Let f be the function f(n) = n - 1, when n > 0 and f(0) = 0. Show that f is computable.\n We need to find a Turing machine M that computes f. Specifically, we want M to erase two of the 1s in \nthe input \u2329n\u232a when n > 0, but only one 1 when n = 0. This is accomplished with the following quintuples:\nq1 = s01Bs1R,  q2 = s1BBsHR,  q3 = s11BsHR\nHere q1 erases the first 1 and moves M right. If there is only one 1, then M is now scanning a blank symbol \nB, and q2 tells the computer to halt. Otherwise, q3 erases the second 1 and halts M.\n13_Spiegel_section XIII_246-253.indd   253 31/08/17   10:52 am254Section XIV: Mathematical Finance\n53 BASIC PROBABILITY\n53.1.
