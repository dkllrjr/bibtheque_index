A sphere \ncontact quantification model was developed to estimate the concentration of contact between them for any \nsimple random mixture. Comparing the evolution of gain of CO conversion (or hydrocarbon yield) with the \ntheoretical results, it was shown that the density of contact was identified as the key factor for the catalytic \nperformances (contact-activity relationship). Finally, the knowledge of the contact morphology, determined by \nFEG-SEM, allowed proposing the NH3-TPD as method characterizing the concentration of contact.   \n1.Introduction \nLight (C2-C4) hydrocarbons are important chemical building blocks \nfor a variety of useful derivatives in the petrochemical and chemical \nindustries [1,2] . They are presently produced worldwide in huge \namounts mostly by steam cracking of naphta which is highly \nenergy-consuming process. C2-C4 hydrocarbons synthesis from syngas \n(a mixture of CO and H2) is attractive since renewable carbon resources \n(biomass, wastes, CO2) are expected to gradually replace fossil fuels [3]. \nFischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis is the traditional process of converting \nsyngas to hydrocarbons [4]. However, the FT process is limited by the \nAnderson\u0000Schultz\u0000Flory (ASF) distribution and contain a small yield of \nC2-C4 hydrocarbons [5,6] . \nA two-step process including methanol synthesis (Reaction 1) fol-\nlowed by methanol-to-olefins (MTO, Reaction 2) process is commer -\ncially available to produce light hydrocarbons but development of a \nmore energetically and costly-efficient direct process is needed [7]. \nCO+2H2\u21ccCH 3OH (Reactionn 1)  \nnCH 3OH\u2192CnH2n+nH 2O (Reactionn 2) \nThe advantage of the single-step process is the achievement of both reactions (Reactions 1 and 2) in one reactor in order to simplify the \nprocess route and equipment [4]. This process is possible using a \nso-called hybrid or bifunctional catalyst. The bifunctional catalyst cor-\nresponds to a physical mixture of methanol synthesis catalyst (Cu-Z -\nnO-Al 2O3) and zeotype (SAPO-34), can lead to the formation of light \nhydrocarbons from syngas via methanol as reactional intermediate [4,8, \n9]. The main advantage of the single-step process is the elimination of \nthe restriction of methanol synthesis by the thermodynamic equilibrium \nshift (drain-off mechanism) [10]. It can be assumed therefore that the \nproximity between methanol synthesis catalyst and SAPO-34 (where the \nmethanol is converted) plays a significant role in the catalytic perfor -\nmances (high. CO conversion) and in the hydrocarbon selectivity [9]. \nIn the present work, we investigated the activity of hybrid catalyst \nfor the CO hydrogenation into hydrocarbons (HC) as a function con-\ncentration of contact between methanol synthesis catalyst (M1) and \nSAPO-34 (M2). In order to evaluate the effect of the proximity between \nM1 and M2, different catalytic bed dispositions (layer bed, denoted LB, \nand simple random mixture, denoted SRM) of both components have \nbeen adopted. Using a similar methodology as previously described [11, \n12], we built contact \u2013reactivity relationship on the basis of catalytic \nobservations. The results led us to formulate hypotheses concerning the \nmorphology of the contacts, as well as the development of a \n*Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: anthony.le.valant@univ-poitiers.fr (A.

Experimental data were compared with theo-\nretical calculations to validate the model. Finally, the knowledge of the \ncontact morphology, determined by field emission gun scanning elec-\ntron microscope (FEG-SEM), allowed proposing a method to charac -\nterize the concentration of contact of each hybrid catalyst. \n2.Materials and methods \n2.1. Materials \n2.1.1. Methanol synthesis catalyst \nA commercially available methanol synthesis copper-based catalyst \n(M1) was used. This is a material developed by Johnson Matthey and \nsold by Alfa Aesar (a Johnson Matthey company) in the form of \n5.4mm\u00d73.6mm pellets. These pellets were crushed and sized to \n160\u0000100 \u00b5m (in this form, the apparent density of the M1 (denoted \n\u03c1M1) material is equal to 1.23 gcm-3 and the radius of the M1 material is \nrM1 =65.0 \u00b5m). \n2.1.2. SAPO-34 \nA SAPO-34 zeolite (M2) in the form of fine powder was purchased \nfrom ACS Material. It was pelletized, crushed and sized to 160\u0000100 \u00b5m \n(in this form, the apparent density of the M2 (denoted \u03c1M2) material is \nequal to 0.94 gcm-3 and the radius of the M2 material is rM2 =65.0 \u00b5m). \n2.1.3. Hybrid catalysts \n2.1.3.1. Layer bed arrangements. The layer bed arrangements (denoted \nxLB(y), where x and y represent the number of layers and the number of \ncontacts, in terms of contact section between M1 and M2, respectively) \nare presented in the Table S1. The same amount of M1 (160\u0000100 \u00b5m) \nand M2 (160\u0000100 \u00b5m) reference materials was used for each of LB arrangement. The differences between the LB arrangements are the \nnumber of alternating layers between M1 and M2, resulting a change in \nthe number of contacts (see Table S1). \n2.1.3.2. Simple random mixture arrangements. The simple random \nmixture arrangements (denoted SRM(x), where x represents the M2 \nproportion) were prepared by simple mixing M1 (160\u0000100 \u00b5m) and M2 \n(160\u0000100 \u00b5m) reference materials with different weight ratios. The \ncharacteristics of SRM arrangements are presented in the Table S2. \n2.2. Characterization of materials \nThe morphology of the M1, M2 and reduced SRM(0.50) (reduced in \nthe same conditions as the catalytic test, see paragraph 2.3) catalysts \nwere studied using a field emission gun scanning electron microscope \n(FEG-SEM) 7900F from JEOL. This microscope is equipped with an \nEnergy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS) from Bru\u00a8cker (with Esprit \nsoftware) allowing the mapping of the Cu, Zn, Al, Mg, Si, P, O and C \ncontents. \nInductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) \nwas used for the determination of the metal content in M1 and M2 \nsamples. The measurements were performed with a Perkin Elmer Op-\ntima 2000DV spectrometer. The M1 sample was previously dissolved in \nan acidic mixture of HNO 3 and HCl to perform the analyses for Cu, Zn, Al \nand Mg. The M2 sample was dissolved into H2SO4 +HNO 3 +HF at \nboiling point to perform the analyses for Al and P. For the Si determi -\nnation, the solid was fused with lithium tetraborate into a Pt-Au crucible \nat 1100\u25e6C. The obtained solid was then dissolved into HCl. \nThe textural properties of the M1 and M2 catalysts were determined \nby adsorption \u2013desorption of nitrogen at the temperature of liquid ni-\ntrogen (\u0000196\u25e6C, 77K) using a Micromeritics Tristar and ASAP 2000 \ninstruments. Before measuring, the M1 was degassed at 250\u25e6C for 4h \nand the M2 was heated at 350\u25e6C overnight. The SBET surface areas were \nFig. 1.FEG-SEM images (a and b) and EDX mapping analysis (c) of M1 catalyst.  V. L\u2019hospital et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n3calculated according to the method of Brunauer, Emmet and Teller \n(BET). The Smicro surface area and Vmicro volume pore of M2 catalyst \nwere determined with the t-plot method. The Sexter external surface area \ncorresponds to the difference between SBET and Smicro and the Vexter \nexternal pore volume to the difference between the total pore volume \nand the Vmicro. \nIn situ X-ray diffractograms were carried out using a D8 advance \ndiffractometer in Bragg-Brentano configuration equipped with a Cu \nanode (Cu K\u03b1 radiation: 0.154184 nm) and a LynxEye XET 1-D detector. \nThe samples were mounted in an atmosphere-controlled Anton Paar \nXRK 900 reactor chamber. X-ray diffractograms were recorded in pure \nH2 (20mL\u22c5min-1) before and after reduction at 400\u25e6C for 30min with a \nstep of 0.03\u25e6(2\u03b8) and a counting time per step of 2s \nA Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 apparatus was employed for the \ntemperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurement. Approxi -\nmately 100mg of freshly M1 catalyst was introduced between two \nquartz wool balls into a quartz U-shaped tube. The TPR experiments was \ncarried out in 10% H2/Ar flowing at a rate of 30 NmL min-1 with a \ntemperature increase from 30\u25e6to 400\u25e6C at 5\u25e6Cmin-1 using a pro-\ngrammable temperature controller. Hydrogen consumption was moni -\ntored by a TCD detector. \nThe ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH 3-TPD) \nmeasurement was undertaken using a homemade apparatus equipped \nwith a TCD detector. For the analysis, 250mg of catalyst (M1, M2, LB \nand SRM arrangements) was placed in quartz reactor between two \nquartz wool layers. The catalyst was pretreated as follows: the temper -\nature of the catalyst bed was increased to 400\u25e6C (5\u25e6Cmin-1) under a H2 \nflow (30 NmL min-1) and this temperature was maintained for 30min. \nNext, the sample was purged with He at the same temperature and \nduration. Finally, the catalyst was cooled down to 100\u25e6C and this temperature was maintained for 30min. Adsorption of ammonia was \nthen carried out at 100\u25e6C for 60min. After purging with helium for \n60min, the analysis was carried out at a heating rate of 10\u25e6Cmin-1 from \n100\u25e6to 700\u25e6C. \nIn situ DRIFT spectra were achieved with a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spec-\ntrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with Praying Mantis \u2122 High \nTemperature Reaction Chamber (Harrick, model HVC-DRP-4) and MCT \ndetector cooled by liquid N2. The spectral resolution was 4cm-1. The \ntemperature gradient between the regulation thermocouple and the \nupper part of the powder sample was previously determined and cor-\nrected. The samples were firstly pre-treated at 400\u25e6C under 20mL.min-1 \nof He flow for 1h before NH3 chimisorption under 30mL.min-1 of 1% \nNH3-He flow and purging under 20mL.min-1 of He flow for 1h. Spectra \nwere then recorded from room temperature up to 400\u25e6C. \n2.3. Catalysis \nCatalytic performances of M1, M2, LB and SRM arrangements were \ncompared in a continuous fixed-bed stainless steel reactor (L =400mm, \n\u00d8int =6.35 mm). The details of the different arrangements used in this \nstudy are illustrated in Tables S1 and S2. For 2LB(0) arrangement, M1 \nand M2 were separated with a layer of SiC (0.60 g). \nBefore reaction, the catalyst was pre-treated in situ at 400\u25e6C for \n30min (heating rate of 5\u25e6Cmin-1) under a flow of pure H2 (1.8 NL h-1) \nat atmospheric pressure. Then, the reactor was purged with argon and \nthe pressure was increased to 30bar. The reactor was then flushed with \nthe reactant gas mixture (H2/CO/Ar:53/21/26, 6 NL h-1) at 400\u25e6C. The \noutlet flow was decompressed and periodically injected in an Agilent \n7890 A gas chromatograph (GC) connected online. All the lines con-\nnecting the reactor with the GC were kept at 200\u25e6C to avoid product \nFig. 2.FEG-SEM images (a and b) and EDX mapping analysis (c) of M2 catalyst .  V. L\u2019hospital et al.

The GC was equipped with three channels: the first one \nconsisted of two series connected of HP PLOT 5A molecular sieve col-\numn (for H2 and CO) and a HP PLOT Q molecular sieve column (for CO2 \nand H2O) connected to a TCD detector, while the second channel con-\nsisted of a HP INNOWAX capillary column (for methanol) connected to a \nFID detector and finally the third channel consisted of a GS-Q capillary \ncolumn (for hydrocarbons) connected to another FID detector. \nThe CO conversion was calculated using the following equation \n(Eq.1): \nXCO(%)=FCO,in\u0000FCO,out\nFCO,in\u00d7100 (1)  \nwhere FCO,in and FCO,out are the molar inlet and outlet CO flows. \nThe selectivity to a product (i) is calculated by comparing the molar \nflow of the product (i) and the total amount of CO converted (Eq.2): \nSi=ni\u00d7 F i\nFCO,in\u0000 FCO,out\u00d7100 (2)  \nwhere ni and Fi are the carbon atom numbers in the product (i) and the \nmolar flow of the product (i). 3.Results and discussions \n3.1. M1 and M2 characterizations \n3.1.1. Morphological, textural and physicochemical properties of methanol \nsynthesis catalyst (M1) \nFEG-SEM images of the M1 commercial methanol synthesis catalyst \nare shown in Fig. 1. The morphology of catalyst M1 behaves like \nirregular particles. Fig. 1 shows the results of EDX elemental analysis of \nthe obtained M1 material. The oxygen, aluminum, copper, zinc, mag-\nnesium and carbon elements were detected. \nThe composition of the M1 commercial methanol catalyst was also \ndetermined by ICP-OES: the weight percentages of CuO, ZnO, Al2O3 and \nMgO are 55.3, 21.7, 7.8 and 1.1wt% (the missing 14.1 wt% corre -\nsponding to carbon and water), respectively (Table S3). \nThe BET surface area (SBET)and pore volume (Vexter) of the M1 \ncompound are approximately 97m2 g-1 and 0.20 cm3 g-1 (Table S3), \nrespectively. \nXRD patterns of fresh and reduced M1 are shown in Fig. S1. Fresh M1 \ncatalyst exhibit crystallized phases of CuO (tenorite structure), ZnO \n(zincite structure), (Cu0.8Zn0.2)2(OH) 2(CO 3) (zincian malachite struc-\nture) and carbon (graphitic structure). No phase containing Al2O3 or \nMgO was detected with XRD, due likely to amorph forms. After reduc -\ntion under H2 at 400\u25e6C, CuO is fully reduced to metallic copper whereas \nZnO stays in its zincite form. \nThe reducibility of M1 catalyst was also evaluated by H2-TPR. The \nTPR profile is shown in Fig. S2. This profile is characterized by the main \npeak centered at 241\u25e6C and ascribed to the reduction of CuO to metallic \nCu. The amount of H2 consumption (VH2) and the H2/Cu ratio are re-\nported in Table S3. According to the stoichiometry of the CuO reduction \n(CuO+H2\u2192Cu+H2O), the value of H2/Cu molar ratio, equal to one, \nFig. 3.Evolution of (a) the conversion and (b) the selectivity values and the P/ \nO ratio versus the number of contacts in LB arrangements at 15h of reaction. \nReaction conditions: m(M1+M2)=1.20 g, P=30bar, T=400\u25e6C, H2/CO/ \nAr=53/21/26, WHSV(xLB(y))=5L.h-1.g-1 and WHSV(for M1 alone)=10L.h- \n1.g-1 (the P/O ratio represents the proportion of paraffins relative to olefins). \nFig. 4.Evolution of the conversion (a) and evolution of the selectivity values \nand the P/O ratio (b) versus the M2 content in SRM arrangements at 15h of \nreaction.

L\u2019hospital et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n5indicates that 100% of copper is reduced to a metallic state under the \nreaction conditions, which is in accordance with the reduced M1 XRD \nmeasurement. \n3.1.2. Morphological and textural properties of SAPO-34 (M2) \nThe morphology of the M2 SAPO-34 commercial material is shown in \nFig. 2. The M2 grains behave like a stack of micro-scale cubes (Fig. 2a \nand b). This cubic morphology is characteristic of the chabazite \nstructure. \nFig. 2c shows the results of EDX elemental analysis of the M2 ma-\nterial. The oxygen, aluminum, silicon, and phosphorus elements were \ndetected. As can be seen, the distribution of the elements is very ho-\nmogenous on the surface of M2 sample. The composition of the M2 \nSAPO-34 commercial material, determined by ICP-OES, is 8.9, 34.1 and \n36.1 wt% (the missing 20.9 wt% corresponding to water) for SiO2, \nAl2O3 and P2O5, respectively (Table S4), with a Si/Al ratio equal to 0.22. \nThe XRD pattern, displayed in Fig. S3, shows the typical diffraction \npeaks assigned to the chabazite structure at 9.6, 13.2, 16.2, 20.8, 26.0, \nand 31.1\u25e6. The SBET surface area and the Vexter external pore volume of \nthe M2 are approximately 475m2 g-1 and 0.03 cm3 g-1 (Table S4). The \nSmicro surface area and the Vmicro micropore volume are 463m2 g-1 and \n0.23 cm3 g-1, respectively. \n3.2. Catalytic performances \n3.2.1. M1+M2 arrangements \n3.2.1.1. Catalytic performances with layered bed (LB) arrangements. The \nimpact of the contact concentration between M1 and M2 is investigated \nusing the different layered bed arrangements present in the Table S1. \nThe performance of M1 and different catalytic layered bed arrangements \nat 15h of reaction is shown in Fig. 3 (the evolution of the CO conversion \nand the product selectivities versus the time on stream is presented in \nFig. S4). The M1 catalyzed the conversion of syngas to CH4, CO2 and \nhydrocarbons (denoted HC, mostly C2H6) with selectivities of approxi -\nmately 45%, 40% and 10%, respectively. The CO conversion (denoted \nXCO) is approximately 7% (with WHSV=10L.h-1.g-1, see Fig. 3a); and methanol (denoted MeOH) and dimethylether (denoted DME) traces are \nobserved (Fig. 3b). These results clearly indicate that, under our \nexperimental conditions, M1 favors the methanation and Water Gas \nShift (WGS) reactions at the expense of methanol synthesis reaction, \nwhich is also in agreement with the thermodynamic equilibrium data \npresented in Table S5. No activity is observed for M2 alone (not pre-\nsented here). When the M2 catalyst is associated with the M1 catalyst, \nwithout contact (2LB(0) arrangement, where M1 and M2 are separated \nfrom each other by a 1cm thick layer of SiC), the CO conversion (Fig. 3a) \nand the CH4 and CO2 selectivities (Fig. 3b) are not changed compared to \nthe test with the M1 catalyst alone. However, the disappearance of \nMeOH and DME is observed in favor of hydrocarbons. When the both \ncatalysts are in contact (2LB(1), 4LB(3), 6LB(5), 8LB(7) and 10LB(9) \narrangements), an increase in CO conversion (Fig. 3a) and HC selectivity \n(mostly C3H8) and a decrease in CH4 selectivity are observed (Fig. 3b, \nthe CO2 selectivity is constant for all the catalytic tests). This phenom -\nenon is amplified with the increase in the number of contacts between \nM1 and M2 layers. The formation of hydrocarbons is explained by the \ntransformation of methanol intermediate formed over M1 into hydro -\ncarbons over M2 acid sites, thus inhibiting the CO methanation and/or \nthe hydrogenation of MeOH into CH4 over M1[13]. The intimacy be-\ntween both materials leads to a strong increase in the proportion of \nparaffins relative to olefins (see the P/O ratio in Fig. 3b), indicating the \nhydrogenation of the olefins. Hydrogen spillover (from M1 to M2) \nand/or olefins spillover (from M2 to M1) and/or the hydrogenation of \nolefins by crossing through a layer of M1 would probably explain this \n[14,15] . \nIt is possible to estimate the gain of CO conversion (denoted XCOgain ), \ninduced by the proximity between M1 and M2, by subtracting the CO \nconversion value of the xLB(y) catalyst (denoted XCO) with the value of \nM1 catalyst (denoted XCOM1), according with the following equation \nEq.3:  \nXCOgain =XCO - XCOM1                                                                   (3) \nwith XCOM1 =7%. \nThe XCOgain (see Fig. 3a) scales linearly with the number of contacts, \nwith an interception at zero. This result clearly evidences that the \nFig. 5.(a) two-dimensional multicomponent packing, (b) tetrahedral subunits (Orange and yellow spheres represent M1 and M2, respectively.), (c) evolution of \ncontact concentrations and (d) evolution of the normalized M1-M2 contact concentration and the normalized XCOgain of SRM versus M2 content (with \nrM1=rM2=65.0 \u00b5m, \u03c1M1=1.23gcm\u00003 and \u03c1M2=0.94gcm\u00003). V. L\u2019hospital et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n6XCOgain is directly correlated with the M1-M2 contact concentration. \nThis proximity eliminates restriction of methanol synthesis by the \nthermodynamic equilibrium shift and enhanced the CO conversion (and \ntherefore the production of HC). \n3.2.1.2. Catalytic performances with simple random mixture (SRM) \narrangements. In order to improve the CO conversion, different simple \nrandom mixtures of M1 and M2 were made. Different compositions of \nthese SRM arrangements were used to vary the contact concentration \nbetween M1 and M2. The same total amount of M1+M2 catalysts was \nused for each of SRM arrangement. The characteristics of SRM ar-\nrangements are presented in the Table S2. \nThe impact of the composition of the SRM arrangement at 15h of \nreaction is illustrated in Fig. 4 (the evolution of the CO conversion and \nthe product selectivities versus the time on stream is presented in \nFig. S5). The conversion of CO as a function of the M2 proportion pre-\nsents a volcano-type profile (Fig. 4a). No activity is observed for M2 and \nlittle for M1 (XCO=11.2% with WHSV=5L.h-1.g-1), while their combi -\nnation demonstrates synergy, with a maximal CO conversion \n(XCO=54.1%, which is much higher than the CO conversions obtained \nwith the LB arrangements) located around 50% of M2 proportion. When \nthe M2 proportion increases (see Fig. 4b), the HC (mostly C3H6) selec-\ntivity quickly increases (until a plateau around 50% of M2 content) at the expense of the CH4 selectivity while the CO2 selectivity is constant \nfor all the catalytic tests (\u224840%). The proportion of paraffins also \npresents a volcano-type profile with a maximum located around 50% of \nM2. \nWith the same approach as the LB arrangements, it is possible to \nestimate the gain of CO conversion (denoted XCOgain ), for each SRM \ncomposition (using Eq.3 with XCOM1 =xM1 \u00d711.2, where xM1 and 11.2 \nrepresent the M1 mass fraction (see Table S2) in the corresponding SRM \ncatalyst and the CO conversion of the M1 catalyst alone at WHSV=5L. \nh-1.g-1, respectively). The XCOgain for the SRM arrangements (see Fig. 4a) \npresents, also, a volcano-type profile with a maximum located around \n50% of M2. \nIn order to validate the M1\u2013M2 proximity hypothesis (directly \nobserved with the LB arrangements), it is necessary to answer this \nquestion: \u2018what is the influence of the SRM catalyst composition on the \nM1-M2 proximity responsible for CO conversion? \u2019. \n3.3. Sphere contact quantification model in randomly packed binary \nmixtures for SRM arrangement \nTo investigate whether the volcano-curve profile of the XCOgain , for \nthe SRM arrangements, can be explained by the number of contacts \nbetween M1 and M2 as postulated, it is necessary to quantify it in a \nFig. 6.(a) FEG-SEM image, (b) Cu (red) and P (yellow) EDX mapping analysis of reduced SRM(0.50) catalyst, Cu (red) and P (yellow) EDX mapping of the surface of \n(c) M1 and (d) M2 grains and (e) schematic representation of the reduced SRM(0.50) catalyst.

Applied Catalysis A, General 643 (2022) 118757\n7dense packing of randomly distributed binary spheres (simplified rep-\nresentation of the SRM arrangement in Fig. 5a with rM1=rM2, it was also \nassumed that the grain size of M1 and M2 did not change during the \nreduction) as well as in mixtures of different compositions, according \nwith the methodology used in our previous study to determine the \nconcentration of number of contacts between two materials [12]. With \nthe statistical and geometric approach of the Dodds model [16,17] , it is \npossible to easily describe the texture of a 3D polydisperse random \nmixture. The Dodds model assumes that each particle constituting the \npolydisperse mixture is in contact with all its neighbors. This basic hy-\npothesis allows to divide the space into tetrahedral subunits ijkl (i, j, k \nand l representing the indices of the species constituting the four vertices \nof a tetrahedron), containing a part of vacuum and each vertex being the \ncenter of a given particle. A binary random mixture (composed of 2 \nfamilies of type 1 and 2 particles, representing M1 and M2, respectively \nfor this study) has 5 types of tetrahedral subunits (1111, 1112, 1122, \n1222, and 2222, Fig. 5b). These different tetrahedral subunits are \ngeometrically fully characterized with the angles a, b and c at the \nsummit i, the spherical angles \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 and the area AT of the spherical \ntriangle (ABC) [18]. The geometry of such a tetrahedral subunit is \ncompletely described by the radii of the four spheres forming it (ri, rj, rk \net rj). By knowing the particles radii and their distributions in number, it \nis possible to determine coordination numbers, porosity, and distribu -\ntion of the different contact types in the polydisperse mixture. In the \nspirit of the Dodds model, model calculations were performed. A \nmathematical model was developed in order to determine the concen -\ntration of number of contacts between M1\u2013M1, M2\u2013M2, and M1\u2013M2 \n(denoted [NC11], [NC22], and [NC12] and expressed in number of \ncontacts per gram of catalyst) for any composition of the SRM catalyst \n(see Fig. 5c, all the details of the proposed model are presented in the \nsupporting information in the section \u201cDescription of the contact \nmodel \u201d). \nIn order to have a representative view of the impact of the M1-M2 contacts in the XCOgain , we compared the evolution of the normalized \nconcentration of number of contacts between M1\u2013M2 with the \nnormalized XCOgain as a function of the M2 proportion in the catalyst \n(Fig. 5d). It clearly appears that the obtained volcano curve for the \nconcentration of number of contacts between M1 and M2 with a \nmaximum at 50% M2 is identical to the one obtained for the normalized \nXCOgain . This result validates the contact \u2013reactivity relationship \nhypothesis. \n3.4. Reduced SRM arrangement structure and morphology \nWe observed that the CO conversion is dramatically affected by the \nSRM catalyst composition, and therefore by the amount of M1-M2 \ncontacts present in the hybrid materials. We investigated the structure \nand textural parameters for the best CO conversion catalyst (SRM(0.50)) \nto understand the nature of M1-M2 contacts. The XRD diffractogram at \nthe fresh plotted in Fig. S6a is a linear combination of the M1 and M2 \nones. After reduction, it corresponds to a combination of the diffracto -\ngram of reduced M1 and to the one of SAPO-34 for which the peaks are \nslightly shifted to the low angles (Fig. S6b). This shift could be due to \ncationic exchange within the zeotype. [19,20] The morphology of the \nreduced SRM(0.50) catalyst obtained by FEG-SEM measurements is \npresented in Fig. 6 (see also Fig. S7 in supporting Information for the \ncomplete EDX mapping analysis). The reduced catalyst behaves like a \ndense packing of randomly distributed binary grains with grain sizes \nsimilar to those of the fresh hybrid catalyst (Fig. 6a), which agrees with \nthe starting point of our theoretical model (Fig. 5a). In order to differ -\nentiate the nature of each catalyst grain, a mapping of the main char-\nacteristic elements of M1 and M2 (Cu (in red) and P (in yellow), \nrespectively) was carried out (Fig. 6b). It can be seen that, after the \nreduction, this granular mixture includes not only conventional contacts \nbetween the grains of M1 and M2 (as one might expect), but also a \ndecoration of the surface of the grains of M1 by microcubes of M2 (see \nFig. 7.(a) NH3-TPD profiles of M1, M2, LB and SRM arrangements (m(M1+M2)=0.250 mg) and M1+M2 represents a linear combination of the corresponding M1 \nand M2 NH3-TPD profiles) and (b) NH3-TPD subtraction profiles.

A generic \nstructure for reduced SRM catalysts is schematically presented in Fig. 6e. \nThese grain decorations optimize the intimacy between M1 and M2 \n(M1/M2 interphase) which is promote the elimination of the restriction \nof methanol synthesis by the thermodynamic equilibrium shift and \ntherefore increase of the CO conversion. \n3.5. Characterization of the M1-M2 contacts \nThe quantity of interphases between M1 and M2 can be determined, \nindirectly, using the properties of a Cu exchanged SAPO-34 synthesis \nmethod, generally used for the selective catalytic reduction with \nammonia (NH 3-SCR) [19]. This method, named solid-state ion-exchange \n(SSIE), consists in mixing copper oxide with SAPO-34 and heating it at low temperature (T<250\u25e6C) under an atmosphere of NH3, which leads \nto the diffusion of metal ions in the zeolite [19]. The mobility of Cu is \nproposed to be related to the formation of complexes [Cu(I)(NH 3)x]+\n(x\u22652). Indeed, these linear complexes have a diameter similar to that of \nan NH3 molecule, thus allowing these species to easily penetrate into the \nporous system of the zeolite and thus to improve the Cu exchange. One \ncan thus easily imagine that if one carries out this method with our \nmaterials (LB and SRM arrangements), the mobility of Cu should in-\ncrease with the concentration of contact between M1 and M2. The use of \nNH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH 3-TPD) on our materials \nallows not only to perform the SSIE process during the NH3 adsorption \nstep, but also to indirectly quantify the amount of Cu exchanged in M2 \n(and therefore a representation of M1-M2 contact concentration). \nFig. 7a shows the NH3-TPD profiles on LB and SRM arrangements \n(the dimensions of our NH3-TPD reactor did not allow us to perform the \nmeasurements for the 8LB(7) and 10LB(9) arrangements). These profiles \nare characterized by three desorption peaks: a low temperature (LT) \npeak at ~200\u25e6C (assigned to NH3 adsorbed to Lewis acid sites [21\u201327]), \nan intermediate temperature (IT) peak at 250\u2013350\u25e6C (corresponding to \nNH3 adsorbed on Cu-sites [21\u201325] created on the zeolite because Cu2+\ncations could exchange with the H+in zeolites partially, introducing \nsome cations to the framework [28,29] ) and a high temperature (HT) \npeak (>400\u25e6C, attributed to NH3 adsorbed on Br\u00f8nsted acid sites i.e. \nformation of NH4+[20\u201324]). NH3-TPD of reduced SRM(0.50) followed \nby DRIFT spectroscopy (Fig. S8) confirmed the presence of Lewis acid \nsites (bands at 3385 \u20133335, 3275, 1622, 1274 and 1219 cm-1) and \nBr\u00f8nsted acid sites (3270, 1490 \u20131450 cm-1) as well as NH3 adsorbed on \nCu+sites on SAPO-34 (3184 cm-1). A detailed attribution is provided in \nthe supporting information . \nIn order to better understand the shape of the LB and SRM ar-\nrangements NH3-TPD profiles, measurements were carried out on \ndifferent masses of M1 and M2 alone. From these new profiles, it was \npossible to simulate theoretical NH3-TPD profiles, corresponding to \nmixtures of M1+M2 without contacts (M1+M2(x), where x represents \nthe M2 content), using linear combination from the characteristic M1 \nand M2 profiles to the masses of the different LB and SRM arrangements \nused. The theoretical profiles obtained are shown in Fig. 7a. \nWhen the M2 catalyst is associated with the M1 catalyst without \ncontact, it is observed that the experimental profile of 2LB(0) is an exact \ncopy of the profile of M1+M2(0.50) simulated profile (the total acidity \nmeasured for 2LB(0) of 1230 \u00b5molg-1 is in perfect agreement with the \nvalue calculated for M1+M2(0.50) of 1238 \u00b5molg-1). When both cat-\nalysts are in contact (2LB(1), 4LB(3), 6LB(5) and SRM arrangements), \nthe experimental profiles are no in agreement with the simulated pro-\nfiles. An increase in the intensity of the IT peak (corresponding to NH3 \nadsorbed at Cu-sites) and an increase in the total acidity are observed, \nindicating a change in behavior linked to the migration of Cu within the \nzeolite. \nFig. 7b shows the results of subtractions between experimental \nprofiles (for the 2LB(1), 4LB(3), 6LB(5) and SRM arrangements) with the \ncorresponding simulated profiles. We observe not only the presence of \nthe peak at intermediate temperature at 340\u25e6C (IT1) but also the \nappearance of a new peak close to 400\u25e6C (IT2). As demonstrated by \nChen et al. [30], species that contribute to the IT1 and IT2 peaks could \nbe the decomposition of the [Cu(I)(NH 3)2]+and [Cu(II)(OH)(NH 3)3]+\ncomplexes, respectively. In order to have a representative view of the \neffect of the contact between M1 and M2 over the Cu migration, the total \nconcentration of both peaks (IT1 and IT2) versus the number of contacts \nin LB arrangements and versus the M2 content in SRM arrangements are \nshown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. It clearly appears that the evolu -\ntions of the concentration of new peaks are identical to those obtained \nfor XCOgain of LB and SRM arrangements (in Figs. 3a and 4a). The evo-\nlution of XCOgain obtained with the LB and SRM arrangements scales \nlinearly with the concentrations of new peaks, with an interception to \nzero (see Fig. 8c). This result clearly evidences that the NH3-TPD mea-\nsurements can be used to quantify contacts between M1 and M2 for one \nFig. 8.(a) Evolution of the new NH3-TPD peaks concentrations versus the \nnumber of contacts in LB arrangements and (b) versus the M2 content in SRM \narrangements, (c) Evolution of the XCOgain of the LB and SRM arrangements \nversus the new NH3-TPD peaks concentration.

When the SAPO-34 catalyst was associated with the Cu-ZnO- \nAl2O3 catalyst (LB arrangement), without contact, CO conversion has \nnot changed compared to the test with the M1 catalyst alone. However, \nthe disappearance of methanol and DME was observed in favor of hy-\ndrocarbons (with a significant selectivity toward CH4 and CO2). When \nboth catalysts were in contact (LB arrangement), an increase of CO \nconversion and HC selectivity and a decrease of CH4 selectivity were \nobserved. This phenomenon is amplified with the increase of the contact \nconcentration. In order to improve the CO conversion, different SRM of \nCu-ZnO-Al 2O3 and SAPO-34 were made. The impact of the composition \nof the SRM hybrid catalyst was investigated and shown a volcano-like \nprofile for CO conversion as a function of M2 content in the catalyst. \nTo elucidate the effect of composition on CO conversion a mathematical \nmodel for Cu-ZnO-Al 2O3 and SAPO-34 contact quantification, based on a \ngeometrical and statistical approach allowing the textural description of \na random polydisperse medium, was developed. The experimental re-\nsults were compared with theoretical calculations. A direct correlation \nwas found between theory and experiment. The density of contact be-\ntween Cu-ZnO-Al 2O3 and SAPO-34 was identified as the key factor for \nthe catalytic performances (contact-activity relationships). Finally, the \nknowledge of the contact morphology, determined by FEG-SEM, \nallowed proposing the NH3-TPD as the concentration of contact char-\nacterization method. \nDeclaration of Competing Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial \ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence \nthe work reported in this paper. \nAcknowledgments \nThe French National Research agency \u201cAgence Nationale de la \nRecherche \u201d (ANR) is acknowledged for the financial support of the INCH \nproject (ANR-17-CE07 \u20130011). \nAppendix A.Supporting information \nSupplementary data associated with this article can be found in the \nonline version at doi:10.1016/j.apcata.2022.118757 . \nReferences \n[1]M.
